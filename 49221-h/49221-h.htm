<span class="smaller">TO</span><br />

THE MEMORY OF OLIVER CROMWELL.</h2>


<p>These verses compose the earliest of our author's political poems,
and are among the first which he wrote, of any length or consequence.
The first edition is now before me, by the favour of my friend Richard
Heber, Esq.; and, while correcting this sheet, I received another
copy from Mr Finlay, author of the "Vale of Ellerslie." It is of the
last degree of rarity, since it has escaped the researches even of Mr
Malone. The full title is, "A Poem upon the Death of his late Highness
Oliver, Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland; written by
Mr Dryden. London, printed for William Wilson, and are to be sold in
Well-Yard, near Little St Bartholomew's Hospital, 1659," 4to. Upon
comparing this rare edition with those of a later date, no material
alterations occur, excepting that the spelling is modernized, and the
title abridged.</p>

<p>Some of our author's biographers have deemed it necessary to
apologise for his chusing this subject, by referring to his near
connection with Sir Gilbert Pickering, the friend and confident of
the deceased usurper. There is, however, little reason to suppose,
that Dryden did any violence to his own inclinations, to gratify the
political feelings of his kinsman and patron. He had been bred in
anti-monarchical principles, and did not probably change, till the
nation changed with him. The character of Cromwell was in itself an
inviting theme to so true a poet. The man, of whom Clarendon said,
that "even his enemies could not condemn him, without commending him
at the same time," and of whose exploits Cowley has given so animating
a detail; whom, in short, his very enemies could not mention without
wonder, if they with-held applause,&mdash;afforded to those who
favoured his politics many a point of view, in which the splendour of
his character might hide its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> blemishes.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is remarkable, however, that, in handling this theme,
Dryden has observed a singular and happy delicacy. The topic
of the civil war is but slightly dwelt on; and, although Cromwell
is extolled, his eulogist abstains from any reflections against
those, through whom he cut his way to greatness. He considers the
Protector when in his meridian height, but passes over the steps by
which he attained that elevation. It is also remarkable, that although
Sir Gilbert Pickering was one of Richard Cromwell's council,
our author abstains from any compliment to that pageant of
authority; when a panegyrick upon the son was a natural topic
of consolation after mourning over the loss of his father. Sprat,
upon the same occasion, did not omit this obvious topic, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
launched forth into prophecies, to which the event did very little
credit.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding these symptoms of caution and moderation,
the subject of this first public essay of our author's poetical talents
was repeatedly urged against him during the political controversies
in which, through the reigns of Charles II. and his brother,
he was constantly engaged. One offended antagonist carried his
malice so far, as actually to reprint an edition of the Elegy, with
a dull postscript, in which he makes Dryden acknowledge his alleged
apostacy.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the poetical merits of the Elegy, we have elsewhere spoken
more fully. The manly and solemn march of the stanza gave
promise of that acute poetical ear, which afterwards enabled Dryden
to harmonize our verification. The ideas, though often far-fetched,
and sometimes ambiguously expressed, indicate the strength
and vigour of his mind. They give obvious tokens of a regeneration
of taste; for though, in many instances, the conceits are very
extravagant, yet they are, in general, much more moderate
than those in the Elegy upon Lord Hastings, whose whole soul
was rendered a celestial sphere, by the virtues which were stuck in
it; and his body little less brilliantly ornamented by the pustules
of small pox, which were first rose-buds, and then stars. The
symptoms of emerging from the false taste and impertinent witticisms
of Donne and Cowley, were probably more owing to our
author's natural feeling of what were the proper attributes of poetry,
than to any change in the taste of the age. Sprat, who also
solemnizes the decease of Cromwell, runs absolutely riot in pindarics,
and furnishes as excellent an instance of useless labour, and
wit rendered ridiculous by misapplication, as can be found in Cowley
himself. Cromwell's elevation is compared to the raising up
of the brazen serpent, in the Pentateuch;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the classic metamorphosis
of Ajax's blood into the hyacinth<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> furnishes a simile
for the supposed revival of letters through the blood spilled
by Cromwell; his sword is preferred to the flaming brand of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>cherub, because it had made a paradise, which the other only guarded;
finally, the Protector's temper grew milder in the progress of
his warfare, as his armour, being made of steel, grew smoother by
use.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It must be allowed, that there are, in Dryden's poem,
many, and greatly too many, epigrammatic turns; each is, however,
briefly winded up in its own stanza; while the structure
of Sprat's poem enabled him to hunt down his conceits through
all the doubling and winding of his long pindaric strophé. Dryden,
for example, says, that Cromwell strewed the island with victories,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Thick as the galaxy with stars is sown.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sprat spins out nearly the same idea, in the following extraordinary
manner:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Others' great actions are</div>
  <div class="i2">But thinly scattered, here and there;</div>
  <div class="i2">At best, but all one single star;</div>
  <div class="i2">But thine the milky way;</div>
  <div class="i0">All one continued light of undistinguished day.</div>
  <div class="i0">They thronged so close, that nought else could be seen,</div>
  <div class="i1">Scarce any common sky did come between.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By turning the reader's attention to this comparison betwixt the
poems of Sprat and Dryden, I mean to shew, that our author was already
weaning himself from that franticly witty stile of composition, which
the most ingenious of his contemporaries continued to practise and
admire; although he did not at once abandon it, but retrenched his
quaint conceits before he finally discarded them.</p>

<p>The poem of Waller on Cromwell's death, excepting one unhappy
and celebrated instance of the bathos,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
is the best of his compositions; and, separately considered, must be
allowed to be superior to that of Dryden, by whom he was soon after so
far distanced in the poetical career.</p>

  <div class="i0"><i>And now 'tis time; for their officious haste,</i></div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cromwell's disease, a fever and tertian ague, was accompanied
by fits of swooning, which occasioned, more than once, a premature
report of his death. It was probably this circumstance, which
made some of his fanatical chaplains doubt the fact, after it had
actually taken place. "Say not he is dead," exclaimed one of them,
like Omar over the corpse of Mahomet; "for, if ever the Lord
heard my prayers, he has assured me of the life of the Protector."
The two last lines of the stanza allude to the Roman custom of
letting an eagle fly from the funeral pile of a deceased emperor,
which represented his spirit soaring to the regions of bliss, or his
guardian genius convoying it thither. It is described at length
in the fourth book of Herodian, who says, that, after this ceremony
of consecration, the deceased emperor was enrolled among
the Roman deities.</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cromwell was upwards of forty before he made any remarkable
figure; and Pompey, when he had attained the same period of
life, was deserted by the good fortune which had accompanied
his more early career.</p>

</div>

<p>Essex, Manchester, Sir William Waller, and the earlier generals of
the Parliament, were all of the Presbyterian party, who, though they
had drawn the sword against the king, had no will to throw away the
scabbard. They were disposed so to carry on the war, that, neither
party being too much weakened, a sound and honourable peace might have
been accomplished on equal terms. But the Independants flew at higher
game; and, as the more violent party usually prevail during times of
civil discord, they attained their object. Cromwell openly accused the
Earl of Manchester of having refused to put an end to the war, after
the last battle at Newbury, when a single charge upon the King's rear
might have dissipated his army for ever. "I offered," he averred, "to
perform the work with my own brigade of horse; let Manchester and the
rest look on, if they thought fit: but he obstinately refused to permit
the attempt, alleging, that, if the king's army was beaten, he would
find another; but if that of the Parliament was overthrown, there would
be an end of their cause, and they would be all punished as traitors."
This suspicion of the compromising temper of the Presbyterian leaders,
led to the famous <em>self-denying ordinance</em>, by which all members of
both houses were declared incapable of holding a military command.
By this new model, all the power of the army was thrown, nominally,
into the hands of Fairfax, but, really and effectually, into that of
Cromwell, who was formally excepted from the operation of the act, and
of the Independants; men determined to push the war to extremity, and
who at length triumphed over both King and Parliament.</p>

  <div class="i1"><i>To staunch the blood, by breathing of the vein.</i>&mdash;St. XII. <a href="#Page_10">p. 10.</a></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This passage, which seems to imply nothing farther than that
Cromwell conducted the war so as to push it to a conclusion, was
afterwards invidiously interpreted by Dryden's enemies, as containing
an explicit approbation of the execution of Charles I.</p>

<p>Thus, in the panegyric quoted in the introductory remarks to this
poem,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Such wonders have thy powerful raptures shewn,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pythagoras' transmigration thou'st outdone;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">His souls of heroes and great chiefs expired,</div>
  <div class="i0">Down into birds and noble beasts retired:</div>
  <div class="i0">But then to savages and monsters dire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Canst infuse sparks even of celestial fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">Make treason glory, murderers heroes live,</div>
  <div class="i0">And even to regicides canst godhead give.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus in thy songs the yet warm bloody dart,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fresh reeking in a martyred monarch's heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">Burnished by verse, and polished by thy lines,</div>
  <div class="i0">The rubies in imperial crowns outshines;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whilst in applause to that sad day's success,</div>
  <div class="i0">So black a theme in so divine a dress,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy soaring flights Prometheus' thefts excel,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whilst thou steal'st fire from heaven to enlighten hell.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same accusation is urged in another libel, called "The
Laureat:"</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Nay, had our Charles, by Heaven's severe decree,</div>
  <div class="i0">Been found, and murdered in the royal tree,</div>
  <div class="i0">Even thou hadst praised the fact. His father slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou call'dst but <em>gently breathing of a vein</em>.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Impious and villainous, to bless the blow</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And gave the royal cause a fatal overthrow!</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another witling, to add to the heinousness of this expression,
assures us, that Dryden had at first declared for the king, then for
the parliament, and, finally, for Cromwell:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I for the Royal Martyr first declared,</div>
  <div class="i0">But, ere his head was off, I was prepared</div>
  <div class="i0">To own the Rump, and for that cause did rhime;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, those kicked out, next moment turned to him</div>
  <div class="i0">Who routed them: called him my sovereign,</div>
  <div class="i0">And praised his opening of the kingly vein.</div>
  <div class="i2"><cite>Dialogue in Bedlam between Oliver's Porter, Fidler, and Poet.</cite></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are examples of the inveteracy, with which Dryden's enemies
were ready to wrest his expressions from the common interpretation into
one more strong and unwarrantable. Dryden, sufficiently embarrassed
by the praises he had bestowed on the Usurper, a charge from which he
could not vindicate himself, took no notice of the uncandid lengths to
which it was carried.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the inconstancy of Victory during the civil
war, she never deserted the banner of Cromwell. Even in undecided
conflicts, the brigade, or wing, with which he fought, had always
the superiority. The royalists never once saw him fly before
them, during all the pitched battles in which he was engaged
in England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

<p>This odd simile is borrowed from a very singular, and somewhat
dubious event, said to have happened during the siege of Bologna
in 1512. A mine had been run by the Spanish besieging army
under a part of the wall, on which was built a chapel dedicated
to the Blessed Virgin. Upon the explosion, the chapel and portion
of the wall which formed its support were heaved into the
air, so high, that (in spite of all the smoke and dust accompanying
such an eruption) an elegant historian assures us, the besiegers
could see, through the vacant space, the buildings of the
town, and the defenders ready to man the breach. Nevertheless,
the chapel and fragment of wall descended so exactly into the
space they had formerly occupied, that the breach was completely
and accurately repaired. The chapel acquired by this incident
a great reputation for miraculous sanctity. The event is
more fully narrated in the following passage of the original:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Finita in ultimo la mina, e stando l'esercito armato per dare
incontinente la battaglia, la quale perchè si desse con maggiori
forze, era stata richiamata l'antiguardia, fece il Navarra dare il
fuoco alla mina; la quale con grandissimo impeto, e romore gittò
talmente in alto la cappella, che per quello spatio, che rimase tra'l
terreno, e'l muro gittato in alto, fu da quelli, ch' erano fuora, veduta
apertamente la città dentro, et i soldati che stavano preparati
per difenderla; ma subito scendendo in giừ ritornò il muro intero
nel luogo medesimo, onde la violentia del fuoco l'areva sbarrato, e
si ricongiunse insieme, come se mai non fusse stato mosso: onde si
non si potendo assaltare da quella parte, i capitani giudicurono non</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>

<p>The gallant Ormond, who commanded for the king in Ireland, had reduced
the island almost entirely under the royal authority, excepting the
cities of Dublin and Londonderry, when the arrival of Cromwell, appointed
lord governor by the parliament, entirely changed the scene. In less than
ten months, that fated general over-ran the whole kingdom. Tredagh he
took by storm; and such terror was struck into the minds of the Irish, by
the bloody execution attending and following that assault, that almost
all the other garrisons surrendered without resistance, or revolted to
the parliament.</p>

<p>Cromwell's wars in Scotland form a brilliant part of his history.
After narrowly escaping the snares of the veteran Lesley, whose admirable
man&oelig;uvres compelled him, with woeful anticipations of farther
misfortune, to retreat towards Dunbar, he was enabled, by the rashness of
the Scottish kirkmen, totally to defeat that fine army. Edinburgh castle
next surrendered; and the war being carried across the Forth, the Scots
were again routed with slaughter at Inverkeithing. Then followed the
irruption of the king into England, and the fatal defeat at Worcester,
which Cromwell used to call his "crowning mercy."</p>

<p>Scotland is here called treacherous, because, having been the first
to take up arms against King Charles I. she was the last to lay them
down in behalf of his son; or rather, because the Presbyterian party in
that country joined the young King against the Independants, as they had
joined the Parliament against the Prelatists: for, the war, which in
England related chiefly to dissentions concerning the Civil government,
was in Scotland entirely to be referred to religious controversy.</p>

<p>Cromwell certainly did much to civilize Scotland. Some of his benefits
were intentionally conferred, others flowed indirectly from the measures
he adopted for the consolidation of his own authority. The English
judges, whom he appointed, introduced into the administration of justice
a purity and vigour, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Scotland had been hitherto unacquainted.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> By the impoverishment,
exile, and annihilation of the principal baronial families, the chains of
feudal bondage were lightened upon the peasantry; and the pay of 18,000
men, levied to maintain the constituted authorities, enriched the lower
orders, amongst whom it was spent. The English soldiers also introduced
into Scotland some of the arts of a more civilized country. We may,
however, hesitate to believe, that they taught the citizens of Aberdeen
to make shoes and plant kail; because Dr Johnson, upon whose authority
the tradition is given, informs us, that the peasantry live upon that
vegetable alone, and that, when they had not kail, they probably had
nothing; in which case, the English military guests had better have
learned from their Aberdonian hosts the art of living upon nothing,
than taught them a branch of gardening which their habits of abstinence
rendered totally superfluous. But the garrisons established by Cromwell
upon the skirts, and in the passes of the Highlands, restrained the
predatory clans, and taught them, in no gentle manner, that respect for
the property of their Lowland neighbours, which their lawful monarchs had
vainly endeavoured to inculcate. An officer of engineers, quartered at
Inverness shortly after 1720, says, that the name of Oliver still struck
terror through the Highlands; and one very ancient laird declared to him,
the appearance of the Protector's colours were so strongly impressed on
his memory, that he still thought he saw them before his eyes, spread
out by the wind, and bearing, in great golden characters, the word
<em>Emanuel</em>.&mdash;<cite>Letters from the North of Scotland</cite>, Vol. I. p. 274.</p>

<p>The war betwixt the republics had been disastrous to the Dutch, and
the peace of 1654 was degrading to the States, though not proportionally
disadvantageous. They consented to desert the cause of the exiled
Stuarts, and to punish the authors of the massacre at Amboyna; they
yielded to the English the honour of the flag in the narrow seas; they
agreed to pay to the East India Company eighty-five thousand pounds, in
compensation of damage done to them; and they consented to the cession of
the island of Polerone in the East Indies: lastly, by a secret article,
the province of Holland guaranteed an assurance, that neither the young
Prince of Orange, whose connection with the exiled family rendered him
an object of the Protector's suspicion, nor any of his family, should be
invested with the office of Stadtholder.</p>

<p>In 1655, Cromwell allied himself with the rising power of France
against the declining monarchy of Spain; less guided, probably, by
any general views of political expedience, than by the consideration,
that the American and West India settlements of the latter power
lay open to assault from the English fleet; while, had he embraced
the other side, his own dominions were exposed to an invasion
from the exiled king, with French auxiliaries. The splendid
triumphs of Blake gave some ground for the poetical flourishes in
the text.</p>

<p>The poet alludes to the exertions of the six thousand British
auxiliaries, whom Cromwell sent to join Marshal Turenne in Flanders.
These veterans, seasoned to the desperate and close mode of fighting,
which the inveteracy of civil war had introduced, astonished the French
by their audacity, and their contempt of the usual military precautions
and calculations. There is a curious account, by Sir Thomas Morgan, of
their exploits at Dunkirk and Ypres, which occurs in the third volume
of the Harleian Miscellany, p. 326. The Duke of York was then with the
Spanish army; and Dryden, on the change of times, lived to celebrate him
for his gallant opposition to that body, which he here personifies as the
British Lion. See the Dedication of the "Conquest of Granada," Vol. IV.
p. 11. The English were made "free-men of the continent" by the cession
of Dunkirk; and it is believed, that this was the first step towards
giving England a share in the partition of Flanders, when that strange
project was disconcerted by the death of Cromwell. There was no avoiding
allusion to the British Lion. Sprat has also sent him forth, seeking whom
he may devour:</p>

<p>The pope being called Alexander the Sixth, Dryden did not
disdain to turn this stanza upon an allusion to the Macedonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
hero; although it is obvious, that the pontiff was not a more effectual
guardian to his city by bearing that warlike name, than if
he had been called Benedict or Innocent. True it is, however,
that the pope feared, and with great reason, some hostile attack
from the powerful English squadron which swept the Mediterranean,
under the command of Blake. Conscious that his papal
character rendered him the object of the most inveterate enmity
to the military saints of Cromwell's commonwealth, he had every
reason to believe that they would find pride, pleasure, and profit,
in attacking Antichrist, even in Babylon itself.</p>

<p>A powerful army and squadron were sent by Cromwell, under
the command of Penn and Venables, to attack Hispaniola. The
commanders quarrelled, and the main design misgave: they took,
however, the island of Jamaica, whose importance long remained
unknown; for, notwithstanding the manner in which Dryden has
glossed over these operations in the West Indies, they were at the
time universally considered as having been unfortunate. See "The

<p>Tarpeia, the virgin who betrayed a gate of Rome to the Sabines,
demanded, in recompense, what they wore on their left arms, meaning
their golden bracelets. But the Sabines, detesting her treachery, or not

related to their bucklers, and flung them upon her in such numbers as to
kill her.</p>

<p>The circumstance, of the dreadful storm which happened on the
day of Cromwell's death, is noticed by all writers. Many vessels
were dashed on the coast, and trees and houses were overthrown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
upon the land. It seemed as if that active spirit, which had rode
in the whirlwind while he lived, could not depart without an universal
convulsion of nature. Waller has touched upon this remarkable
incident with great felicity:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">We must resign; heaven his great soul does claim,</div>
  <div class="i0">In storms as loud as his immortal fame;</div>

  <div class="i0">New Rome in such a tempest missed her king,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from obeying fell to worshipping.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, while the authors of these threnodies explained this prodigious
storm as attendant on the deification of the Protector, or
at least the effects of the Genius of Britain's unbounded lamentation,
the cavaliers unanimously agreed, that the tempest accompanied
the transportation of his spirit to the infernal regions.</p>

<p>This prophecy, like that announcing the final close of civil
broils, in the preceding stanza, was not doomed to be accomplished.
The contending factions resumed their struggles in a month after the
Protector's death; his body was dragged from the burial place of
princes, to be exposed on the gibbet; and his head placed on the end
of Westminster Hall. There is, however, an unauthenticated story, that
Cromwell, foreseeing the Restoration, had commanded his remains to be
interred secretly, and by night, in the field of Naseby, as near as
possible to the spot where his prowess had gained that bloody day; and
that, by a piece of refined and ingenious malice, his friends caused the
body of Charles to be deposited in the empty coffin, which had received
the funeral honours rendered to the Protector; thus turning the disgrace,
which the royalists intended for the body of Cromwell, upon that of the
royal martyr. The story may be found in the Harleian Miscellany, Vol. II.
p. 269. But it is unworthy of credit, and seems to have been grounded
upon the circumstance, that Cromwell's body, being in a very corrupted
state, was buried privately before the grand procession. The restoration
of the house of Stuart seemed then to be an event much out of the reach
of calculation, even to persons less sanguine than Cromwell.</p>

<h2><a name="ASTRAEA_REDUX" id="ASTRAEA_REDUX"></a>ASTRÆA REDUX.<br />

<span class="small80">A POEM.</span></h2>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span></p>

<p>After so many years of civil war and domestic tyranny, the
Restoration, an almost hopeless event, established the crown upon
the head of the lawful successor, and the government upon its
original footing. Dryden, among the numerous, I had almost
said innumerable, bards,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> who celebrated, or attempted to celebrate,
this surprising event, distinguished himself by the following
poem, to which he has given the apt name of <i>Astræa Redux</i>, from
the hopes of justice and liberty returning with the lawful king.</p>

<p>The tone of praise, which Dryden has adopted, exhibits his
usual felicity. There do not here occur any of these rants about
the antiquity of the royal line,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and the indefeasible right of the
lawful successor, which are the common topics of the herd, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
offered poetical congratulation to the restored monarch. Dryden
rejoices with the chastised triumph of one, that had not forgot
what it was to mourn. He looks back, as well as forwards; and
it is upon the past sufferings of the people, and of the monarch,
that he grounds the hope and expectation of their future happiness.
The poet was perhaps sensible, that the claim of loyal merit
was rather new in his family and person, and ought not therefore
to be expressed with the extravagant colouring of the cavaliers.
He ventures indeed upon prophecy, although past experience
might have taught him it was dangerous ground. One prediction,
however, has been (<i>magno licet intervallo</i>) accomplished
to its fullest extent in our own age:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Your much-loved fleet shall, with a wide command,</div>
  <div class="i0">Besiege the petty monarchs of the land.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poem exhibits the taste which belongs to the earlier class of
Dryden's compositions, bearing the same marks of attachment to the stile
of Waller and Davenant. Some of the similes are brought out with singular
ingenuity. Nothing can be more elegant than the turn he gives to the
slow, gentle, and almost imperceptible manner, in which the great change
which he celebrates was accomplished:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; While we</div>
  <div class="i0">The effect did feel, but scarce the manner see.</div>
  <div class="i0">Frosts, that constrain the ground, and birth deny</div>
  <div class="i0">To flowers that in its womb expecting lie,</div>
  <div class="i0">Do seldom their usurping power withdraw,</div>
  <div class="i0">But raging floods pursue their hasty thaw;</div>
  <div class="i0">Our thaw was mild, the frost not chased away,</div>
  <div class="i0">But kindly lost in heat of lengthened day.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, it is surely unnecessary to point out to the
reader the confusion of metaphor, where Virtue is said to dress
the wounds of Charles with laurels;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the impertinent antithesis
of finding "light alone in dark afflictions;" and the extravagance
of representing the winds, that wafted Charles, as out of breath
with joy. These, and other outrageous flights of wit, have been
noticed and blamed by Johnson. I am not certain whether that
great critic is equally just, in severely censuring the passage in
which there is a short allusion to Heathen mythology.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
tender, the passionate, or the sublime, ought to prevail, an allusion
to classical fiction seldom fails to interrupt the tone of feeling
which the author should seek to preserve; but in a poem, of
which elegance of expression and ingenuity of device are the principal
attributes, an allusion to the customs of Greece, or of Rome,
while it gives a classic air to the composition, seems as little misplaced,
as an apt quotation from the authors in which they are recorded.</p>

<p>The first edition of this poem is printed in folio by J. M. for
Henry Herringman, 1660. It affords few and trifling corrections.</p>

<p>The small wits of the time made themselves very merry with
this couplet; because stillness, being a mere absence of sound,
could not, it was said, be personified, as an active agent, or invader.
Captain Ratcliff thus states the objection in his "News

<p>The royal line of Sweden has produced more heroic and chivalrous
monarchs, than any dynasty of Europe. The gallant
Charles X. who is here mentioned, did not degenerate from this
warlike stem. He was a nephew of the great Gustavus Adolphus;
and, like him, was continually engaged in war, particularly
against Poland and Austria. He died at Gottenburgh in 1660,
and the peace of Sweden was soon afterwards restored by the treaty
of Copenhagen.</p>

</div>

<p>The death of Cromwell, and the unsettled state of England,
prevented the execution of those ambitious schemes, which Cardinal
Mazarine, then prime minister of France, had hoped to accomplish
by the assistance of Britain. The Cardinal was therefore,
in 1659, induced to accede to the treaty of the Pyrenees, by
which peace was restored betwixt France and Spain; the union
being cemented by the marriage of the Infanta to Louis XIV.&mdash;Charles
II., then a needy fugitive, was in attendance upon the ministers
of France and Spain, when they met on the frontiers for
this great object; but he, who was soon to be so powerful a monarch,
experienced on that occasion nothing but slights from Mazarine,
and cold civility from Don Lewis de Haro.</p>

<p>This does not mean, as Derrick conceived, that these emblems

<p>The emperor Otho, whose mind and manners exhibited so many
contradictions, is described as one of the most effeminate of
men in his outward habits; his mind, however, was active and
energetic. "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Non erat Othonis, mollis et corpori similis, animus.</i>"
<span class="smcap">Taciti</span>, Lib. i. <cite>Historiarum</cite>.&mdash;He slew himself after the battle of
Brixellum, in which he was vanquished by Vitellius. The prætorian
guards, and his other followers, in vain urged him to try his
fortune again in the field. Whether from that impatience of sustaining
adversity, which luxurious habits seldom fail to produce,
or from the generous desire of ending a disastrous civil war, he
retained and executed his resolution. It is, however, no extraordinary
compliment to Charles, that he did not, after his defeat at
Worcester, follow an example more classical than inviting.</p>

<p>Galba adopted Piso Frugi Licinianus as his successor in the

of Galba upon this occasion: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nunc me, deorum hominumque

<p>This is in imitation of the famous letter which Francis the First
of France wrote to his mother after the battle of Pavia: "Madam,
all is lost except our honour." That of Charles II. certainly
was not lost at Worcester. He gave many marks of personal courage,
and was only hurried off the field by the torrent of fugitives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
He halted a large body of horse, and implored them to return,
and but look upon the enemy; yet, though he advanced at their

<p>The parallel between the French League and the Covenant had
already occurred to Dryden as a proper subject for the stage; for,

<p>Upon the death of Cromwell, in 1659, the cavaliers resolved
upon a general rising; but their intentions being betrayed by Sir
Richard Willis, the insurrection only took place at Chester, which
was seized by Sir George Booth and Sir William Middleton. They
ventured imprudently into the open field to face Lambert, by
whom they were totally routed; so that the royal party in England
never seemed to lie under such total depression, as when it
was about to triumph over all opposition.</p>

<p>Alluding to Cromwell's dissolution of the Long Parliament,
with the memorable words, "Ye are no longer a parliament;
I tell you, ye are no longer a parliament; the Lord has done
with you." General Harrison then pulled the speaker from
the chair; and Worsley, with two file of musketeers, expelled
the refractory members, Cromwell loading each of them with personal
revilings. When the house was cleared, he, with great composure,
locked the doors, and took the key home in his pocket.
Legion was a second time dispossessed by the same kind of exorcism,
when the House of Commons was occupied by that extraordinary
assembly, usually called, from the name of a distinguished
member, "Praise God Barebone's Parliament." This motley
assembly of crazy fanatics, having shewn some disposition to extend
the reign of the saints, in a manner rather inconsistent with
Cromwell's views of exclusive domination, were suddenly dissolved
by him. A remnant, headed by the frantic enthusiast Harrison,
continued to sit till their deliberations were interrupted by
White with a party of soldiers, who demanded, "what they did
there?" "We are seeking the Lord," answered they. "Then go
seek him elsewhere," rejoined the commander; "for to my knowledge
he has not been here these many years." Or Dryden may
have referred to the terms upon which Cromwell parted with his
last parliament; to whom he swore, by the living God, they
should not sit an hour longer; and calling upon the Lord to be
judge between them, (to which many members answered, Amen,)
turned them about their business. Indeed, when we consider, that
the Long Parliament was, after Cromwell's death, restored and
cashiered more than once, the line might have more properly run,</p>

<p>This subtle politician was Lodovico, son of Francisco Sforza.
He was one of the most restless and intriguing spirits, that Italy,
the mother of political genius, has ever produced. His natural
brother, Francisco Sforza, had acquired, by marriage, the duchy
of Milan, which he left to his son Giovanni Galeazzo Sforza.
Lodovico, under pretence of acting as his nephew's tutor, took
into his own hands the supreme power; and, tired of governing
under the name of another, at length deposed and murdered the
young duke. In order to secure himself in his usurped domination,
he invited the French into Italy, which they over-ran and
conquered under Charles VIII. He became soon suspicious of
these too powerful allies, and leagued with the Venetians to cut
off the retreat of the French from Naples. In 1594, he made a
pretended peace with Charles; and, in the year following, invited
into Italy the Emperor Maximilian, by whose assistance he hoped to
secure himself in Pisa, of which he had taken possession, and to conquer
the Florentines, with whom he was at war. In all these, and
many other ambiguous and versatile transactions, Sforza was so happy,
that he used to call himself the Son of Fortune, as he was termed
by others the Moor, from his dark complection, acute genius,
and cruel disposition. But, in 1599, Lewis XII., who had pretensions
upon the dukedom of Milan, as the grandson of Valentine
Visconti, daughter of Giovanni Galeazzo, Duke of Milan, invaded
the Milanese territory with a force which Sforza was unable
to resist, and compelled him to fly into Germany with his treasures.
In 1600, Sforza again returned to Italy at the head of an
army of Swiss mercenaries, and repossessed himself of Milan,
Como, and other places of importance. The Swiss, however, mutinied
at Novara, and not only refused to fight in his behalf, but
even to guard him to a place of security. As these unworthy
Helvetians had made a private convention with the French, they
permitted them to seize the person of Sforza, who was discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
among the ranks of his faithless mercenaries, dressed and armed
like a private Swiss soldier; a lamentable instance of the inconstancy
of fortune. He was carried prisoner to France, where he
ended his days in prison, A. D. 1608.</p>

<p>Those persons, who had sat in any illegal high court of justice,
with a few others, were, at the Restoration, declared incapable of
bearing any public office. In expressing their violent spirit, our author
uses the unnecessary Gallicism <em>fougue</em>, although it might have
been as well described by the English <em>fire</em>. Thus disqualified, the
poet compares these republicans to the Spartan slaves, made drunk
to excite the contempt of the youth for that degrading vice. By

<p>Johnson remarks, that this extraordinary piece of complaisance
in the land is not without a precedent. A French poet read to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Malherbe some verses, in which he mentioned the kingdom of
France as advancing to meet the king. "Though this happened
in my time," observed the critic, "it is strange I should not
remember it." In the next couplet, Albion does penance in a
sheet, because her cliffs are chalky; had they been black, she
would have been in mourning of course. But the civility of such
inanimate objects, according to the poets of this reign, was truly
wonderful, considering their present insensibility. In a poem, "On
the Arrival of her Royal Highness, and Happy Marriage to the
Most Illustrious Prince James Duke of York, &amp;c. 1673," not only
do dolphins dance about the vessel, but, yet more surprising,</p>

<p>By the declaration of King Charles II., dated at Breda, 14th
April, 1660, a free pardon was promised to all subjects, of what
degree or quality soever, for their share in the late civil war, excepting
only such as should hereafter be excepted by Parliament.
The House of Peers, irritated by their sufferings during the late
troubles, were disposed to make very general exceptions from the
proposed indemnity. But the king came in person to the house,
and beseeched them, in the most affecting terms, to extend the
benefit of the bill to all who had not been the immediate instruments
of his father's death. Upon which principle, the "Act of
Oblivion" was constructed accordingly. Even among the judges
of his father, the King distinguished Ingoldsby, and others, as fit
objects of mercy. Thus the law's rigid letter, as pronounced by
him, was "softer made."</p>

<p>Charles II. was born on the 29th of May, 1630, and upon the
same day of the same month, 1660, he "renewed the expiring pomp
of May," by making his triumphal entry into his metropolis, for the
purpose of resuming the throne of his forefathers. The immense
crowds which assembled to witness an event, which was to close
the wounds of civil discord, seemed, says Clarendon, as if the whole
kingdom had been gathered together. For a full account of his
triumphant procession, with the cloth of gold, and cloth of silver,
velvet cloaks, gold chains, kettle-drums, trumpets, and common
council-men, see <i>Baker's Chronicle</i>. One part of the show was
particularly striking to the actors in the late commotions: "I
must confess," says the republican Ludlow, "it was a strange
sight to me, to see the horse that had formerly belonged to our army,
now put upon an employment, so different from that which they
had at first undertaken; especially when I considered, that, for the
most part, they had not been raised out of the meanest of the
people, and without distinction, as other armies had been; but that
they consisted of such as had engaged themselves from a spirit of
liberty, in defence of their rights and religion." <span class="smcap">Ludlow's</span> <i>Memoirs</i>,

<p>There was a star visible on Charles' birth-day, 29th May, 1630;
a circumstance much dwelt upon, by his party, during the civil
wars. Lilly, the astrologer, who embraced the cause of the Commonwealth,
assures us, it was nothing more than the planet Venus,
which is sometimes visible in the day-time; and truly, if we judge
of the matter by its influence on the merry monarch, Venus has
the best title to be held the dominant power at his nativity.
Lilly also repeats the following lines, presented to Charles I. (by
the astrologer himself, I suppose,) when he went to St Paul's, to
return thanks for the birth of his son:</p>

<span class="small90">PANEGYRIC ON HIS CORONATION.</span></h2>


<p>The ceremony of Charles the Second's coronation was deferred
until the year succeeding his Restoration, when it was solemnized
with extreme magnificence, on the 22d April, 1661, being St
George's day. Charles moved from the Tower to Whitehall,
through a series of triumphal arches, stages, and pageants, all of
which presented, at once, the joy and wealth of his people before
the eyes of the monarch. The poets, it may readily be believed,
joined in the general gratulation; but, from the rudeness of their
style, and puerility of their conceits, Charles, whose taste was undoubted,
must have soon distinguished our author's superior energy
of diction, and harmony of language. In most respects we may consider
this piece as written in the style of the preceding, yet with
less affectation of witty and far-fetched allusion. The description
of the spring, beginning, "Now our sad ruins are removed
from sight," is elegantly fancied, and so smoothly expressed, that
even the flow of the language seems to mark the mild and delightful
influence of the season it describes. Much quaintness remains
to be weeded out. The name of the king is sent on high, wrapped
soft and warm in music, like flames on the wings of incense; and,
anon, music has found a tomb in Charles, and lies drowned in her
own sweetness; while the fragrant scent, begun from the royal person,
and confined within the hallowed dome, flies round and descends
on him in richer dew. Above all, we are startled to hear of</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A queen, near whose chaste womb, ordained by fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">The souls of kings unborn for bodies wait.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Neither, if we read (with the first edition) <em>from</em> instead of <em>near</em>,
is the intelligibility, or decorum of the passage much improved.
If any of the souls of these unborn monarchs waited for bodies
from Queen Catharine, they waited long in vain. But with all
these defects, there is in this little piece that animation of language
and idea, which always affords the most secure promise of genius.</p>

<p>The first edition is printed for Henry Herringman, 1661.</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the Restoration, several of the regicides were condemned
to death; but the king, with unexampled lenity, remitted the capital
punishment of many of these deep offenders. Only six of the
king's judges were executed; and, when to that number are added,
the fanatic Peters, who compared the suffering monarch to Barabbas,
Coke, the solicitor, who pleaded against Charles on his mock
trial, and Hacker, who commanded the guard, and brutally instigated,
and even compelled them to cry for execution, we have the
number of nine, who suffered for a fact, the most enormous in civilized
history, till our age produced a parallel. There was also
an insurrection of the fierce and hot-brained sect of fanatics, who
called themselves fifth-monarchy men, and devoutly believed, that
the Millennium, and the reign of the saints, was about to begin.
Willing to contribute their share to this happy consummation,
these enthusiasts, headed by the fanatic Venner, rushed into the
streets of London; and, though but sixty in number, were not
overpowered without long resistance, and much bloodshed. These
incidents, Dryden, always happy in his allusion to the events of
the day, assigns as a reason for deferring the coronation to an
untainted year. Perhaps, however, he only meant to say, that, as
Charles was not restored till May, 1660, the preceding months of
that year were unworthy to share in the honour, which the coronation
would have conferred upon it.</p>

<p>The conferences held at Savoy House, betwixt the presbyterians
and the bishops, excited hopes among those who did not understand
the temper of theological controversy, that these two powerful
divisions of the protestant church might be reconciled to each
other. The quakers, anabaptists, and other inferior sects, applied,
by petitions and humble addresses, to the king, to be permitted to
worship God, according to their consciences. Thus, the whole
modelling of ecclesiastical matters seemed to be in the hands of
the king.</p>

<p>Charles the Second had a strong mechanical genius, and understood
ship-building, in particular, more completely than became
a monarch, if it were possible that a king of England could be too
intimately acquainted with what concerns the bulwark of his empire.
The king's skill in matters of navigation is thus celebrated
by the author of a Poem upon his Majesty's Coronation, the 22d
April, 1661, being St George's day.</p>

<p>By the improvements made by Charles the Second on St James's
Park, there was a connection made with the river, which Waller
has celebrated in these lines, as a work of superior merit to founding
a city.</p>

<p>The canal in St James's park formed a decoy for water-fowl,

is noticed by Waller:</p>

LORD CHANCELLOR HYDE.<br />

<span class="small70">&amp;c.</span></h2>


<p>The great statesman, to whom Dryden made this new-year's
offering, was the well known Earl of Clarendon, of whose administration
Hume gives the following striking account:</p>

<p>"Clarendon not only behaved with wisdom and justice in the
office of chancellor: all the counsels, which he gave the king,
tended equally to promote the interest of prince and people.
Charles, accustomed, in his exile, to pay entire deference to the
judgment of this faithful servant, continued still to submit to his
direction; and for some time no minister was ever possessed of
more absolute authority. He moderated the forward zeal of the
royalists, and tempered their appetite for revenge. With the opposite
party, he endeavoured to preserve, inviolate, all the king's
engagements. He kept an exact register of the promises which
had been made, for any service; and he employed all his industry
to fulfil them."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the merits of Clarendon, and our author's prophecy
in the following verses, that</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">He had already wearied fortune so,</div>
  <div class="i0">She could no longer be his friend or foe;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>this great statesman was doomed to be one of the numberless victims
to the uncertainty of court favour. His fall took place in
1667, when he was attainted and banished. The popular discontent
was chiefly excited against him, by a groundless charge of
corruption; an accusation to which the vulgar lend a greedy and
implicit faith, because ignorance is always suspicious, and low
minds, not knowing how seldom avarice is the companion of
ambition, conceive the opportunities of peculation to be not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
numerous, but irresistibly tempting. Accordingly, the heroes of
Athens, as well as the patriots of Rome, were usually stigmatized
with this crime; bare suspicion of which, it would seem, is
usually held adequate to the fullest proof. Nor have instances
been wanting in our own days, of a party adopting the same mode,
to blacken the character of those, whose firmness and talents impeded
their access to power, and public confidence.</p>

<p>In the address to the Chancellor, Dryden has indulged his ingenuity
in all the varied and prolonged comparisons and conceits,
which were the taste of his age. Johnson has exemplified Dryden's
capacity of producing these elaborate trifles, by referring to
the passage, which compares the connection between the king and
his minister, to the visible horizon. "It is," says he, "so successfully
laboured, that though at last it gives the mind more perplexity
than pleasure, and seems hardly worth the study that it
costs; yet it must be valued, as the proof of a mind at once subtle
and comprehensive." The following couplet, referring to the
friendship of Charles I, when in his distresses, for Clarendon, contains
a comparison, which is eminently happy:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Our setting sun, from his declining seat,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shot beams of kindness on you, not of heat.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In general, this poem displays more uniform adherence to the metaphysical
style of Cowley, and his contemporaries, than occurs in
any of Dryden's other compositions. May we not suppose, that,
in addressing Clarendon, he adopted the style of those muses,
with whom the Chancellor had conversed in his earlier days, in
preference to the plainer and more correct taste, which Waller,
and Denham, had begun to introduce; but which, to the aged
statesman, could have brought no recollection of what he used to
consider as poetry? Certain, at least, it is, that, to use the strong
language of Johnson, Dryden never after ventured "to bring on
the anvil such stubborn and unmanageable thoughts;" and these
lines afford striking evidence, how the lever of genius, like that
of machinery applied to material substances, can drag together,
and compel the approximation of the most unsociable ideas. Our
admiration of both, however, is much qualified, when they are applied
rather to make exhibition of their own powers, than for any
better purpose.</p>

<h2><a name="SATIRE_ON_THE_DUTCH" id="SATIRE_ON_THE_DUTCH"></a>SATIRE ON THE DUTCH.</h2>


<p>This Satire was, as the title informs us, written in 1662: probably
towards the latter end of the year, when Charles, having
quarrelled with De Wit, then at the head of the public affairs of
Holland, was endeavouring to patch up an union with France, to
which kingdom he was naturally partial, against the States, whom
he hated, both as a republic, and an association of vulgar merchants.
This impolitic alliance did not then take place, notwithstanding
the sale of Dunkirk, (conquered by the arms of Cromwell,)
to France, for L.400,000. On the contrary, in 1665 France
armed in defence of Holland. But this was contrary to the expectations
and wishes of Charles; and accordingly Dryden, in 1662,
alludes to the union of the two crowns against the States as a probable
event.</p>

<p>The verses are adapted to the comprehension of the vulgar,
whom they were intended to inflame. Bold invective, and coarse
raillery, supply the place of the wit and argument, with which
Dryden, when the time fitted, knew so well how to arm his satire.</p>

<p>The verses, such as they are, appeared to the author well qualified
for the purpose intended; for, when, in 1672, his tragedy of
"Amboyna" was brought forward, to exasperate the nation against
Holland, the following verses were almost literally woven into the
prologue and epilogue of that piece. See Vol. V. pp. 10. 87.
Nevertheless, as forming a link in our author's poetical progress,
the present Editor has imitated his predecessors, in reprinting
them among his satires and political pieces.</p>

<h2><a name="TO_HER_ROYAL_HIGHNESS" id="TO_HER_ROYAL_HIGHNESS"></a><span class="small50">TO</span><br />

<span class="small70">HER ROYAL HIGHNESS</span><br />

THE DUCHESS OF YORK,</h2>

<p class="p2">ON THE VICTORY GAINED BY THE DUKE OVER THE
DUTCH, &amp;c.</p>


<p>The Duchess, here addressed, was Anne Hyde, daughter of the
Earl of Clarendon, and first wife of James, Duke of York, afterwards
James II. She appears to have been a woman of first-rate
talents, as well as exemplary prudence. Of the last qualification
she gave a singular proof, when her marriage with the Duke was
declared. She had admitted James to her bed while abroad, under
a solemn promise of marriage. Many endeavoured to dissuade
him from completing this unequal alliance; and that a motive, at
least an apology, might be supplied for a retreat from his engagements,
Lord Falmouth, Killigrew, and other courtiers, did not hesitate
to boast of favours received from the lady. When the king's
regard for his minister, and James's attachment to his betrothed
wife, occasioned the confirmation of the marriage, these zealous
witnesses found themselves in an unpleasing predicament, till
the Duchess took an opportunity of assuring them, that she was
far from harbouring the least resentment at the reports they had
raised, since they believed them calculated to promote the interest
of their master and her husband.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> It may be presumed,
that Dryden had already attached himself to the fortunes of the
Duke of York, since he so early addressed the princess, whose
posthumous avowal of the Catholic faith he afterwards attempted
to vindicate.</p>

<p>The victory of the 23d June, 1665, was gained by the British
fleet, commanded by the Duke of York, over the Dutch, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
famous Opdam. It was, like all naval actions between the English
and the Dutch, a fierce, obstinate, and bloody conflict. The
fleets met near Harwich on the 2d June; but the Dutch declined
action upon that day, from a superstitious recollection that it was
the anniversary of a dreadful defeat, received from Blake and
Monk in 1653, in which they lost their famous Admiral, Von
Tromp. But on the morning of the third, the fleets joined battle
so near the shore, that the thunder of the combat was heard all
along the English coast. York and Opdam singled each other
out, and lay alongside in close action, till the Dutch vessel (a second
rate) was blown up, and all on board perished. The Dutch
fleet then dispersed and fled, losing nineteen ships sunk and taken,
while the English lost only one. During this dreadful battle the
Duke of York displayed the greatest personal courage. He was
in the thickest of the fire, when one cannon-shot killed Lord Falmouth,
Lord Muskerry, and Mr Boyle, by his side, and covered
him with the gore of the most faithful and attached companions of
his fortune. Yet this day, the brightest which ever shone on him,
was not without a cloud. When the Dutch fleet were scattered,
and an active pursuit was all that remained to the victors, Brounker,
a gentleman of the Duke's bed-chamber, commanded Sir John
Harman, in the Duke's name, to slacken sail. James was then
asleep, and the flimsy pretext of not disturbing his repose was set
up as a reason for this most untimely interference. The affair was
never well explained. The Duke dismissed Brounker from his
service, and a parliamentary investigation of his conduct took
place.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> But no adequate punishment was inflicted, and the nation
saw, with displeasure, the fruits of a dear-bought and splendid
victory lost by the unauthorized interference of an officious minion.</p>

<p>The Duchess, as we learn, amongst other authorities, from an
old libel, came down to Harwich to see her husband embark, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
afterwards made the triumphant progress to the north, which is
here commemorated. The splendour of her reception at Harwich
is thus censured by the Satirist:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">One thrifty ferry-boat, of mother-pearl,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sufficed of old the Citherean girl;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet navies are but fopperies, when here</div>
  <div class="i0">A small sea mask, and built to court your dear:</div>
  <div class="i0">Three goddesses in one, Pallas for art,</div>
  <div class="i0">Venus for sport, but Juno in your heart.</div>
  <div class="i0">O Duchess, if thy nuptial pomp was mean,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis paid with interest in thy naval scene.</div>
  <div class="i0">Never did Roman Mark, within the Nile,</div>
  <div class="i0">So feast the fair Egyptian crocodile;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor the Venetian Duke, with such a state,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Adriatic marry at that rate.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poem itself is adapted to the capacity and taste of a lady;
and, if we compare it with that which Dryden had two years before
addressed to the Chancellor, it strengthens, I think, very strongly
the supposition, that the old taste of extravagant and over-laboured
conceits, with which the latter abounds, was a stile purposely
adapted to gratify the great Statesman to whom it was addressed,
whose taste must necessarily have been formed upon the
ancient standard. The address, which follows, is throughout easy
and complimentary, much in the stile of Waller, as appears from
comparing it with that veteran bard's poem on the same subject.
Although upon a sublime subject, Dryden treats it in the light
most capable of giving pleasure to a fair lady; and the journey
of the duchess to the north is proposed as a theme, nearly as important
as the celebrated victory of her husband.</p>

<p>Accordingly Dryden himself tells us, in the introductory letter
to the "Annus Mirabilis," that, in these lines, he only affected
smoothness of measure and softness of expression; and the verses
themselves were originally introduced in that letter, to vindicate
the character there given of them.</p>

<p>The noise of the battle was distinctly heard at London, as appears
from the Introduction to our author's "Essay on Dramatic
Poetry," where the dialogue is supposed to pass in a barge, in
which the speakers had embarked to hear more distinctly, "those
undulations of sound, which, though almost vanishing before they
reached them, seemed yet to retain somewhat of their first horror
which they had betwixt the fleets." And, by the sound seeming
to retire from them, Eugenius draws an omen of the enemy's defeat.
This whole scene is imagined with so much liveliness, that
we can hardly doubt Dryden was actually an ear-witness of the
combat.</p>

<p class="p3">ANNUS MIRABILIS.</p>


<p>This is the first poem of any length which Dryden gave to the
public. Formerly he had only launched out in occasional verses,
and, in some instances, on subjects of no prominent importance.
He now spread a broader canvas, and prepared to depict a more
extensive and magnificent scene. The various incidents of an
eventful war between two powerful nations, who disputed the trident
of the ocean, and the tremendous fire, which had laid London in
ashes, were subjects which still continued to agitate the bosoms of
his countrymen. These, therefore, he ventured to assume as the
theme of his poem; and his choice is justified by the effects which
it yet produces upon the reader.</p>

<p>There would have been no doubt, even had the author himself
been silent, that he followed D'Avenant in the choice of the elegiac
stanza, in which the <cite>Annus Mirabilis</cite> is composed. It is sounding
and harmonious to the ear; and perhaps Dryden still annexed to
the couplet the idea of that harshness, which was so long its characteristick
in the hands of our early English writers. But the four-lined
stanza has also its peculiar disadvantages; and they are admirably
stated by the judicious critic, who first turned the Editor's
eyes, and probably those of many others, on the neglected poem
of "Gondibert."&mdash;"The necessity of comprising a sentence within
the limits of the measure, is the tyranny of Procrustes to thought.
For the sake of a disagreeable uniformity, expression must constantly
be cramped or extenuated. In general, the latter expedient
will be practised as the easiest; and thus both sentiment and
language will be enfeebled by unmeaning expletives."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It is nevertheless
true, that Dryden has very seldom suffered his poem to
languish. Every stanza presents us either with vivid description,
or with some strong thought, which is seldom suffered to glide into
tenuity. But this structure of verse has often laid him under an odd
and rather unpleasing necessity, of filling up his stanza, by coupling
a simile, or a moral, expressed in the two last lines, along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the fact, which had been announced in the two first. When these
comments, or illustrations, however good in themselves, appear to
be intruded upon the narrative or description, and not naturally
to flow out of either, they must be considered as defects in composition;
and a kind of versification, which compels frequent recurrence
to such expedients for filling up the measure, has a disadvantage,
for which mere harmony can hardly compensate. In
the passages which follow, there is produced a stiff and awkward
kind of balance between the story and the poet's reflections and
illustrations.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Lawson among the foremost met his fate,</div>
  <div class="i1">Whom sea-green Sirens from the rocks lament:</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus as an offering for the Grecian state,</div>
  <div class="i1">He first was killed, who first to battle went.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="center"><hr class="r15" /></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">To nearest ports their shattered ships repair,</div>
  <div class="i1">Where by our dreadful cannon they lay awed</div>
  <div class="i0">So reverently men quit the open air,</div>
  <div class="i1">Where thunder speaks the angry gods abroad.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="center"><hr class="r15" /></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Like hunted castors, conscious of their store,</div>
  <div class="i1">Their way-laid wealth to Norway's coasts they bring;</div>
  <div class="i0">There first the North's cold bosom spices bore,</div>
  <div class="i1">And winter brooded on the eastern spring.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When, after such verses, we find one in which the author expresses
a single idea so happily, as just to fill up the <i>quatrain</i>, the
difference is immediately visible, betwixt a simile easily and naturally
introduced, and stanzas made up and levelled with what a
poet of those times would perhaps have ventured to call the <i>travelled
earth</i> of versification:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And now four days the sun had seen our woes;</div>
  <div class="i1">Four nights the moon beheld the incessant fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">It seemed as if the stars more sickly rose,</div>
  <div class="i1">And farther from the feverish north retire.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of all these difficulties our author seems to have been aware,
from his preliminary epistle to Sir Robert Howard; and it was probably
the experimental conviction, that they were occasionally invincible,
which induced him thenceforward to desert the <i>quatrain</i>;
although he has decided that stanza to be more noble, and of
greater dignity, both for the sound and number, than any other
verse in use among us.</p>

<p>The turn of composition, as well as the structure of the verse,
is adopted from "Gondibert." But Dryden, more completely master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the English language, and a writer of much more lively imagination
and expression, has, in general, greatly exceeded his master
in conceiving and bringing out the far-fetched ideas and images,
with which each has graced his poem. D'Avenant is often harsh
and turgid, and the construction of his sentences extremely involved.
Dryden has his obscure, and even unintelligible, passages;
but they arise from the extravagance of the idea, not from the
want of power to express it. For example, D'Avenant says,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Near her seems crucified that lucky thief,</div>
  <div class="i1">In heaven's dark lottery prosperous more than wise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who groped at last by chance for heaven's relief,</div>
  <div class="i1">And throngs undoes with hopes by one drawn prize.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We here perfectly understand the author's meaning, through his
lumbering and unpoetical expression; but, in the following stanza,
Dryden is unintelligible, because he had conceived an idea approaching
to nonsense, while the words themselves are both poetical
and expressive:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then we upon our globe's last verge shall go,</div>
  <div class="i1">And view the ocean leaning on the sky;</div>
  <div class="i0">From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know,</div>
  <div class="i1">And on the lunar world securely pry.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In short, Dryden never fails in the power of elegant expression,
till he ventures upon something which it is impossible to express.</p>

<p>The love of conceit and point, that inveterate though decaying
disease of the literature of the time, has not failed to infect the
<i>Annus Mirabilis</i>. That monstrous verse, in which the extinction
of the fire is described, cannot be too often quoted, both to expose
the meanness of the image, and the confusion of the metaphor;
for it will be noticed, that the extinguisher, so unhappily
conceived, is not even employed in its own mean office. The flames
of London are first a tallow candle; and secondly hawks, which,
while pouncing on their quarry, are hooded with an extinguisher:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">An hollow crystal pyramid he takes,</div>
  <div class="i1">In firmamental waters dipt above;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of it a broad extinguisher he makes,</div>
  <div class="i1">And hoods the flames that to their quarry drove.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Passages also occur, in which, from the author's zealous desire
to be technically minute, the style becomes low and vulgar. There
is no doubt, that, as Dryden has observed, the proper terms of
art may be not only justly, but with the highest advantage, employed
in poetry; but such technical phrases require to be selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
with great judgment: they must bear relation to some
striking and important object, or they are mean and trivial; and
they must be at once generally intelligible, and more expressive
in themselves than ordinary language, or they are unnecessarily
obscure and pedantic. Dryden has failed in both these points, in
his account of the repairs of the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Stanza 148, in particular,
combines the faults of meanness and unnecessary obscurity,
from the affected use of the dialect of the dock-yard:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Some the galled ropes with dawby marline bind,</div>
  <div class="i1">Or searcloth masts with strong tarpawling coats:</div>
  <div class="i0">To try new shrouds one mounts into the wind,</div>
  <div class="i1">And one below their ease or stiffness notes.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other examples might be produced of the faults of this remarkable
poem; but it is time to say, that they are much overbalanced
by its beauties. If Dryden is sometimes obscure, from the
extravagance of his imagination, or the far-fetched labour of his
similes, and if his desire to use appropriate language has occasionally
led him into low and affected minuteness, this poem exhibits
a far greater number of instances of happy and judicious illustration,
beautiful description, and sublime morality. The comparison
of the secret rise of the fire of London to the obscure birth
of an usurper, is doubly striking, when we consider how closely
the passage may be understood to bear reference to the recent
domination of the Protector.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> I will not load these preliminary
observations, by inserting the whole of the striking passage,
on the different manner in which the night, after the battle of the
first of June, was passed on board the English and Dutch fleets;
but certainly the 71st stanza will not lose, by being an hundred
times quoted:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">In dreams they fearful precipices tread;</div>
  <div class="i1">Or, shipwrecked, labour to some distant shore;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or in dark churches walk among the dead;</div>
  <div class="i1">They wake with horror, and dare sleep no more.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The verses, in which Prince Rupert and his enemy are compared
to a greyhound and hare, after a course so desperate as totally
to exhaust both, have been always considered as exquisitely
beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The description of the Loyal London partakes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>beauties and faults which are dispersed through the poem. Nothing
can be more majestic than her description, "firing the air
with her sanguine streamers," and "riding upon her shadow in
floating gold." We lament, that the weaver should have been so
fascinated with his labours as to commence seaman; and still
more, that, after describing her "roomy decks," and "depth of
draught," she should furnish no grander simile than that of</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;a sea-wasp floating on the waves.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>More unqualified approbation may be justly afforded to the
whole description of the Dutch homeward-bound fleet, captured
in sight of their desired haven; and the fine moral lessons which
the poet takes the opportunity to inculcate, from so unexpected
an incident. The 34th stanza has a tenderness and simplicity,
which every lover of true poetry must admire:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">This careful husband had been long away,</div>
  <div class="i1">Whom his chaste wife and little children mourn;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who on their fingers learned to tell the day</div>
  <div class="i1">On which their father promised to return.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I will only point out to attention the beautiful and happily expressed
simile of the eagle in stanzas 107 and 108, and then, in
imitation of honest John Bunyan,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">No more detain the readers in the porch,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The title of <i>Annus Mirabilis</i> did not, according to Mr Malone,
originate with Dryden; a prose tract, so intitled, being published
in 1662.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Neither was he the last that used it; for, the learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
editor of "Predictions and Observations, collected from Mr J.
Partridge's Almanacks for 1687 and 1688," has so entitled his astrological
lucubrations.</p>

<p>The <i>Annus Mirabilis</i> was first printed in octavo, in 1667, the
year succeeding that which was the subject of the poem. The
quarto edition of 1688, which seems very correct, has been employed
in correcting that of Derrick in a few trifling instances.</p>

<p><span class="fontsize">A</span><span class="smcap">s</span>, perhaps, I am the first who ever presented a work of this
nature to the metropolis of any nation, so it is likewise consonant
to justice, that he, who was to give the first example of such a
dedication, should begin it with that city, which has set a pattern
to all others, of true loyalty, invincible courage, and unshaken
constancy. Other cities have been praised for the same virtues, but
I am much deceived if any have so dearly purchased their reputation:
their fame has been won them by cheaper trials than an expensive,
though necessary war, a consuming pestilence, and a more consuming
fire. To submit yourselves with that humility to the judgments of
heaven, and, at the same time, to raise yourselves with that vigour
above all human enemies; to be combated at once from above, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
below; to be struck down, and to triumph,&mdash;I know not whether
such trials have been ever paralleled in any nation: the resolution
and successes of them never can be. Never had prince or people more
mutual reason to love each other, if suffering for each other can
endear affection. You have come together a pair of matchless lovers,
through many difficulties; he, through a long exile, various traverses
of fortune, and the interposition of many rivals, who violently
ravished and with-held you from him; and certainly you have had
your share in sufferings. But providence has cast upon you want of
trade, that you might appear bountiful to your country's necessities;
and the rest of your afflictions are not more the effects of God's
displeasure (frequent examples of them having been in the reign of the
most excellent princes) than occasions for the manifesting of your
christian and civil virtues. To you, therefore, this Year of Wonders
is justly dedicated, because you have made it so; you, who are to
stand a wonder to all years and ages; and who have built yourselves
an immortal monument on your own ruins. You are now a Ph&oelig;nix in
her ashes, and, as far as humanity can approach, a great emblem of the
suffering Deity; but heaven never made so much piety and virtue to
leave it miserable. I have heard, indeed, of some virtuous persons who
have ended unfortunately, but never of any virtuous nation: Providence
is engaged too deeply, when the cause becomes so general; and I cannot
imagine it has resolved that ruin of the people at home, which it has
blessed abroad with such successes. I am therefore to conclude, that
your sufferings are at an end; and that one part of my poem has not
been more an history of your destruction, than the other a prophecy of
your restoration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

<p><span class="fontsize">I</span> <span class="smcap">am</span> so many ways obliged to you, and so little
able to return your favours, that, like those who
owe too much, I can only live by getting farther
into your debt. You have not only been careful of
my fortune, which was the effect of your nobleness,
but you have been solicitous of my reputation,
which is that of your kindness. It is not long since
I gave you the trouble of perusing a play for me,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
and now, instead of an acknowledgment, I have given you a greater, in
the correction of a poem. But since you are to bear this persecution, I
will at least give you the encouragement of a martyr,&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
could never suffer in a nobler cause; for I have chosen the most heroic
subject, which any poet could desire. I have taken upon me to describe
the motives, the beginning, progress, and successes, of a most just and
necessary war; in it, the care, management, and prudence of our king;
the conduct and valour of a royal admiral, and of two incomparable
generals; the invincible courage of our captains and seamen; and three
glorious victories, the result of all. After this, I have, in the
Fire, the most deplorable, but withal the greatest, argument that can
be imagined; the destruction being so swift, so sudden, so vast and
miserable, as nothing can parallel in story. The former part of this
poem, relating to the war, is but a due expiation for my not serving
my king and country in it. All gentlemen are almost obliged to it;
and I know no reason we should give that advantage to the commonalty
of England, to be foremost in brave actions, which the nobles of
France would never suffer in their peasants. I should not have written
this but to a person, who has been ever forward to appear in all
employments, whither his honour and generosity have called him. The
latter part of my poem, which describes the Fire, I owe, first, to the
piety and fatherly affection of our monarch to his suffering subjects;
and, in the second place, to the courage, loyalty, and magnanimity of
the city; both which were so conspicuous, that I have wanted words to
celebrate them as they deserve. I have called my poem historical, not
epic, though both the actions and actors are as much heroic as any
poem can contain. But, since the action is not properly one, nor that
accomplished in the last successes, I have judged it too bold a title
for a few stanzas, which are little more in number than a single Iliad,
or the longest of the Æneids. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
reason, (I mean not of length, but broken action, tied too severely
to the laws of history) I am apt to agree with those, who rank Lucan
rather among historians in verse, than Epic poets; in whose room, if
I am not deceived, Silius Italicus, though a worse writer, may more
justly be admitted. I have chosen to write my poem in quatrains, or
stanzas of four in alternate rhyme, because I have ever judged them
more noble, and of greater dignity, both for the sound and number,
than any other verse in use amongst us; in which I am sure I have your
approbation. The learned languages have certainly a great advantage
of us, in not being tied to the slavery of any rhyme; and were less
constrained in the quantity of every syllable, which they might vary
with spondees or dactyls, besides so many other helps of grammatical
figures, for the lengthening or abbreviation of them, than the modern
are in the close of that one syllable, which often confines, and more
often corrupts, the sense of all the rest. But in this necessity of our
rhymes, I have always found the couplet verse most easy, (though not
so proper for this occasion,) for there the work is sooner at an end,
every two lines concluding the labour of the poet; but in quatrains
he is to carry it farther on, and not only so, but to bear along in
his head the troublesome sense of four lines together. For, those, who
write correctly in this kind, must needs acknowledge, that the last
line of the stanza is to be considered in the composition of the first.
Neither can we give ourselves the liberty of making any part of a verse
for the sake of rhyme, or concluding with a word which is not current
English, or using the variety of female rhymes,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
all which our fathers practised; and for the female
rhymes, they are still in use amongst other nations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with the Italian in every line, with the Spaniard
promiscuously, with the French alternately, as
those who have read the Alaric, the Pucelle, or
any of their later poems, will agree with me. And
besides this, they write in Alexandrines, or verses of
six feet; such as, amongst us, is the old translation
of Homer by Chapman:<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> all which, by lengthening
of their chain, makes the sphere of their activity
the larger.</p>

<p>I have dwelt too long upon the choice of my
stanza, which you may remember is much better
defended in the preface to "Gondibert;" and
therefore I will hasten to acquaint you with
my endeavours in the writing. In general I will
only say, I have never yet seen the description of
any naval fight in the proper terms which are used
at sea; and if there be any such, in another language,
as that of Lucan in the third of his Pharsalia,
yet I could not avail myself of it in the English;
the terms of art in every tongue bearing more
of the idiom of it than any other words. We hear
indeed among our poets, of the thundering of guns,
the smoke, the disorder, and the slaughter; but all
these are common notions. And certainly, as those,
who in a logical dispute keep in general terms,
would hide a fallacy; so those, who do it in any
poetical description, would veil their ignorance:<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i>Descriptas servare vices, operumque colores,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Cur ego, si nequeo ignoroque, poeta salutor?</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For my own part, if I had little knowledge of the sea, yet I have
thought it no shame to learn; and if I have made some few mistakes, it
is only, as you can bear me witness, because I have wanted opportunity
to correct them; the whole poem being first written, and now sent you
from a place, where I have not so much as the converse of any seaman.
Yet though the trouble I had in writing it was great, it was more than
recompensed by the pleasure. I found myself so warm in celebrating the
praises of military men, two such especially as the prince and general,
that it is no wonder if they inspired me with thoughts above my
ordinary level. And I am well satisfied, that, as they are incomparably
the best subject I ever had, excepting only the royal family, so also,
that this I have written of them is much better than what I have
performed on any other. I have been forced to help out other arguments,
but this has been bountiful to me; they have been low and barren of
praise,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and I have
exalted them, and made them fruitful; but here&mdash;<i>Omnia
sponte suà reddit justissima tellus</i>. I have
had a large, a fair, and a pleasant field; so fertile,
that, without my cultivating, it has given me two
harvests in a summer, and in both oppressed the
reaper. All other greatness in subjects is only counterfeit;
it will not endure the test of danger; the
greatness of arms is only real. Other greatness burdens
a nation with its weight; this supports it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
its strength. And as it is the happiness of the age,
so it is the peculiar goodness of the best of kings,
that we may praise his subjects without offending
him. Doubtless it proceeds from a just confidence
of his own virtue, which the lustre of no other can
be so great as to darken in him; for the good or
the valiant are never safely praised under a bad or
a degenerate prince.</p>

<p>But to return from this digression to a farther
account of my poem; I must crave leave to tell
you, that as I have endeavoured to adorn it with
noble thoughts, so much more to express those
thoughts with elocution. The composition of all
poems is, or ought to be, of wit;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and wit in the
poet, or wit-writing, (if you will give me leave
to use a school-distinction) is no other than the
faculty of imagination in the writer, which, like a
nimble spaniel, beats over and ranges through the
field of memory, 'till it springs the quarry it hunted
after; or, without metaphor, which searches over
all the memory for the species or ideas of those
things, which it designs to represent. Wit written
is that which is well defined, the happy result of
thought, or product of imagination. But to proceed
from wit, in the general notion of it, to the
proper wit of an Heroic or Historical Poem, I judge
it chiefly to consist in the delightful imagining of
persons, actions, passions, or things. It is not the
jerk or sting of an epigram, nor the seeming contradiction
of a poor antithesis, (the delight of an ill-judging
audience in a play of rhyme,) nor the gingle
of a more poor paronomasia;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> neither is it so much
the morality of a grave sentence, affected by Lucan,
but more sparingly used by Virgil; but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>some lively and apt description, dressed in such colours
of speech, that it sets before your eyes the absent
object, as perfectly, and more delightfully than
nature. So then the first happiness of the poet's
imagination is properly invention, or finding of the
thought; the second is fancy, or the variation, deriving,
or moulding, of that thought, as the judgment
represents it proper to the subject; the third is
elocution, or the art of clothing and adorning that
thought, so found and varied, in apt, significant,
and sounding words. The quickness of the imagination
is seen in the invention, the fertility in the
fancy, and the accuracy in the expression. For the
two first of these, Ovid is famous amongst the
poets; for the latter, Virgil. Ovid images more
often the movements and affections of the mind,
either combating between two contrary passions, or
extremely discomposed by one. His words therefore
are the least part of his care; for he pictures
nature in disorder, with which the study and choice
of words is inconsistent. This is the proper wit of
dialogue or discourse, and consequently of the drama,
where all that is said is supposed to be the effect of
sudden thought; which, though it excludes not the
quickness of wit in repartees, yet admits not a too
curious election of words, too frequent allusions, or
use of tropes, or, in fine, any thing that shews remoteness
of thought, or labour in the writer. On
the other side, Virgil speaks not so often to us in
the person of another, like Ovid, but in his own:
he relates almost all things as from himself, and
thereby gains more liberty than the other, to express
his thoughts with all the graces of elocution,
to write more figuratively, and to confess as well
the labour as the force of his imagination. Though
he describes his Dido well and naturally, in the
violence of her passions, yet he must yield in that
to the Myrrha, the Biblis, the Althæa, of Ovid;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
for, as great an admirer of him as I am, I must acknowledge, that if
I see not more of their souls than I see of Dido's, at least I have
a greater concernment for them: and that convinces me, that Ovid has
touched those tender strokes more delicately than Virgil could. But
when action or persons are to be described, when any such image is to
be set before us, how bold, how masterly, are the strokes of Virgil!
We see the objects he presents us with in their native figures, in
their proper motions; but so we see them, as our own eyes could never
have beheld them so beautiful in themselves. We see the soul of the
poet, like that universal one of which he speaks, informing and moving
through all his pictures:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Totamque infusa per artus</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We behold him embellishing his images, as he makes
Venus breathing beauty upon her son Æneas:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;<i>lumenque juventæ</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Purpureum, &amp; lætos oculis afflârat honores:</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Quale manus addunt ebori decus, aut ubi flavo</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Argentum, Pariusve lapis, circundatur auro.</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>See his Tempest, his Funeral Sports, his Combat of
Turnus and Æneas: and in his "Georgics," which I
esteem the divinest part of all his writings, the
Plague, the Country, the Battle of the Bulls, the
labour of the Bees; and those many other excellent
images of nature, most of which are neither great
in themselves, nor have any natural ornament to
bear them up; but the words wherewith he describes
them are so excellent, that it might be well
applied to him, which was said by Ovid, <i>Materium
superabat opus</i>: the very sound of his words has
often somewhat that is connatural to the subject;
and while we read him, we sit, as in a play, beholding
the scenes of what he represents. To perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
this, he made frequent use of tropes, which you
know change the nature of a known word, by applying
it to some other signification; and this is it
which Horace means in his Epistle to the Piso's:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i>Dixeris egregiè, notum si callida verbum</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Reddiderit junctura novum.</i>&mdash;&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But I am sensible I have presumed too far to entertain you with a
rude discourse of that art, which you both know so well, and put into
practice with so much happiness. Yet before I leave Virgil, I must
own the vanity to tell you, and by you the world, that he has been
my master in this poem. I have followed him every where, I know not
with what success, but I am sure with diligence enough; my images are
many of them copied from him, and the rest are imitations of him. My
expressions also are as near as the idioms of the two languages would
admit of in translation. And this, sir, I have done with that boldness,
for which I will stand accountable to any of our little critics, who,
perhaps, are no better acquainted with him than I am. Upon your first
perusal of this poem, you have taken notice of some words, which I have
innovated (if it be too bold for me to say refined) upon his Latin;
which, as I offer not to introduce into English prose, so I hope they
are neither improper, nor altogether inelegant in verse; and, in this,
Horace will again defend me:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i>Et nova, fictaque nuper, habebunt verba fidem, si</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>Græco fonte cadunt, parcè detorta.</i>&mdash;&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The inference is exceeding plain; for, if a Roman
poet might have liberty to coin a word, supposing
only that it was derived from the Greek, was
put into a Latin termination, and that he used this
liberty but seldom, and with modesty; how much
more justly may I challenge that privilege to do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with the same prerequisites, from the best and most
judicious of Latin writers? In some places, where
either the fancy or the words were his, or any other's,
I have noted it in the margin, that I might not seem
a plagiary;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> in others I have neglected it, to avoid
as well tediousness, as the affectation of doing it
too often. Such descriptions or images well wrought,
which I promise not for mine, are, as I have said,
the adequate delight of heroic poesy; for they beget
admiration, which is its proper object; as the images
of the burlesque, which is contrary to this, by the
same reason beget laughter: for, the one shews nature
beautified, as in the picture of a fair woman,
which we all admire; the other shews her deformed,
as in that of a lazar, or of a fool with distorted
face and antique gestures, at which we cannot forbear
to laugh, because it is a deviation from nature.
But though the same images serve equally for the
Epic poesy, and for the Historic and Panegyric,
which are branches of it, yet a several sort of sculpture
is to be used in them. If some of them are to
be like those of Juvenal, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">stantes in curribus Æmiliani</i>,
heroes drawn in their triumphal chariots, and
in their full proportion; others are to be like that
of Virgil, <i>spirantia mollius æra</i>: there is somewhat
more of softness and tenderness to be shewn in
them. You will soon find I write not this without
concern. Some, who have seen a paper of verses,
which I wrote last year to her highness the Duchess,
have accused them of that only thing I could defend
in them. They said, I did <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">humi serpere</i>,&mdash;that
I wanted not only height of fancy, but dignity of
words, to set it off. I might well answer with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of Horace, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nunc non erat his locus</i>; I knew I addressed
them to a lady, and accordingly I affected
the softness of expression, and the smoothness of
measure, rather than the height of thought; and in
what I did endeavour, it is no vanity to say I have
succeeded. I detest arrogance; but there is some
difference betwixt that and a just defence. But I
will not farther bribe your candour, or the reader's.
I leave them to speak for me; and, if they can, to
make out that character, not pretending to a greater,
which I have given them.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>And now, sir, it is time I should relieve you from
the tedious length of this account. You have better
and more profitable employment for your hours, and
I wrong the public to detain you longer. In conclusion,
I must leave my poem to you with all its
faults, which I hope to find fewer in the printing by
your emendations. I know you are not of the number
of those, of whom the younger Pliny speaks;
<i>Nec sunt parum multi, qui carpere amicos suos judicium
vocant</i>: I am rather too secure of you on that
side. Your candour in pardoning my errors may
make you more remiss in correcting them; if you
will not withal consider, that they come into the
world with your approbation, and through your
hands. I beg from you the greatest favour you can
confer upon an absent person, since I repose upon
your management what is dearest to me, my fame
and reputation; and therefore I hope it will stir
you up to make my poem fairer by many of your
blots: if not, you know the story of the gamester
who married the rich man's daughter, and when her
father denied the portion, christened all the children
by his sirname, that if, in conclusion, they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
beg, they should do so by one name, as well as by
the other. But, since the reproach of my faults will
light on you, it is but reason I should do you that
justice to the readers, to let them know, that, if
there be any thing tolerable in this poem, they owe
the argument to your choice, the writing to your
encouragement, the correction to your judgment,
and the care of it to your friendship, to which he
must ever acknowledge himself to owe all things,
who is,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />

<p>The jealousy of commerce between Holland and England recommended
a Dutch war to the nation; while the king, insensible
to the many advances made him by the States, cherished a
hearty detestation at their mode of government, and the manners
of their people in general. Some of the regicides had sought
shelter in Holland; and it was only by the uncommon alertness of
Downes, the British ambassador, that they were seized and sent to
England. Nay, De Witt, and other leaders in the States, kept
up a secret correspondence with Ludlow, and the other banished
republican English, in hopes that their party might yet find
work for Charles in his own kingdom. Meanwhile, they extended
beyond measure their personal deference for Charles; willing to
avoid a war, which, in any event, must be prejudicial to their
commerce, and which, from the valour which the English had
displayed in 1653, might probably be unfortunate. But the interest
of the East Indian and African Companies, both of which
were highly favoured by Charles in the beginning of his reign, and
the unatoned injuries which they had sustained from the Dutch,
were a sufficient counterpoise to every pacific overture on the part
of Holland.</p>

<p>France, a nation ever remarkable for seeing, almost intuitively,
her own interest, was not willing that the domineering spirit of
Cromwell should revive under the restored monarchy of England.
Richelieu had been forced to comply, to a certain extent, with the
rash, and often impolitic, but always energetic and daring, schemes
of the Protector, endeavouring, at the same time, to make them
subservient to his own purposes. But when there was no danger
of England uniting with Spain and Holland against France,
it was much more the interest of that kingdom, that the two
great naval powers should waste their strength in mutual warfare,
or even that France should assist the weaker, than that she should
join with the stronger, to oppress the other entirely. Besides, the
French faction, with De Witt at their head, was now paramount
in Holland; and the indirect effect of any signal success of the
English must be the restoration of the house of Orange, so closely
allied to Charles II., and the hereditary enemy of France, to the
dignity of the office of Stadtholder; an office, which, with the family
who held it, has been uniformly respected or degraded, as the
English or French faction prevailed in the United Provinces. The
French court had therefore various reasons for making the Dutch
"lords by sea," since they could give them "law by land;" and
these finally weighed so deeply, as to lead them to take a part,
though but a cold one, against Britain in this very war.</p>

<p>The Spanish provinces in the Netherlands had always been the
object of French cupidity; and, according to count D'Estrade, a
scheme was now formed for dividing them between France and
Holland; which, however, the French court took great and successful
care to conceal from the party who were to be sufferers.
This policy Dryden has termed, "rocking the cradle of the babe
of Spain."</p>

<p>"As it is on all hands confessed, that never any English, perhaps
I might say, any prince, without distinction of countries, understood
maritime affairs so well as Charles II. did; so it cannot surprise
any intelligent reader, when we assert, that the English navy
received very great advantages from his skill and care in matters of
this nature. It must indeed be allowed, that he found the fleet, at
his restoration, in an excellent situation, and abundance of very
able men employed therein; and it must likewise be confessed, to
the honour of his government, that he preserved them in their several
posts, without any respect to party, which, without question,
contributed not a little to the increase of our naval power. How
intent he was, for the first ten years of his reign, in promoting
whatever had a tendency this way, appears from all the candid
histories of those times, from the collections of orders, and other
public papers relating to the direction of the navy while the duke
of York was admiral, published of late;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and, in a short and narrow

never amounted to less than 500,000l. a year."&mdash;<cite>Lives of the Admirals</cite>,

<p>This battle, one of the most decisive and glorious fought during
the war, our author had already celebrated in the verses to the
Duchess, immediately preceding this poem; to which, and to the
notes, the reader is referred. The famous Dutch admiral Opdam,
in his flag-ship, the Eintracht, blew up, while closely engaged
with the duke of York in the Royal Charles. Shortly afterwards,
four or five Dutch vessels became unmanageable, fell on
board of each other, and were all burned by a single fire-ship. Three
others were destroyed in the same condition, and by the same
means. Two Dutch vice-admirals were killed, whose ships, bearing
away, drew many out of the line, so that Van Tromp, who
fought gallantly, had, out of a hundred and three ships, only thirty
left, to continue a retreating action. This victory was gained on
the 3d. June, 1665.</p>

<p>Sir John Lawson, the gallant seaman here mentioned, rose from
a mean station in the navy, to be an admiral under the Parliament.
He distinguished himself in the Dutch war of 1653, by the incredible
damage which the flying squadron he commanded did to the
commerce of the States. He entered afterwards into some cabals
with the fifth-monarchy-men, a set of pretended saints, who would
hear of nothing but a theocracy. It does not appear, whether, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the part of Lawson, this was an alliance of policy or principle;
but it cost the admiral an imprisonment under the vigilant administration
of Cromwell. He was set at liberty, and declared by the
Parliament vice-admiral of the Channel fleet, which he induced by
his influence to declare for the Restoration. The admiral was rewarded
for this service by the honour of knighthood, and high
trust from his sovereign. In the great battle off Loestoff, sir John
Lawson met the glorious death which Dryden has here commemorated.
He was rear-admiral to the duke of York, and maintained
his high character for valour and seaman-ship till late in the
action, when he received a musket-shot in the knee, and by its
effects was prevented from enjoying the victory, to which he
had greatly contributed. He died a few days after the action, in
full enjoyment of his country's triumph, and his own glory.</p>

<p>The Dutch occasionally conducted their naval expeditions with
great and insolent affectation of superiority. Upon one occasion
their admiral sailed with a broom at his main-top-gallant-mast,
to signify, he had swept the narrow seas of the English. Opdam,
as already mentioned, blew up, while along side of the Duke of
York. Some imputed this accident to the revenge of a negro
slave; others, to some carelessness in the distribution of the ammunition.</p>

<p>This alludes to an action variously judged of, and very much
noted at the period. The Turkey and East India fleets of Holland,
very richly laden, and consisting, according to D'Estrades, of ten
Indiamen, seventeen ships from Smyrna, and twenty-eight from
other ports, valued at 25 millions of livres, having gone north about
to avoid encountering the English, and finding, that they could not
with safety attempt to get into their own harbours even by that
circuitous route, had taken shelter in the bay of Bergen. The
earl of Sandwich, who now commanded the fleet, the duke of York
having gone ashore, dispatched sir Thomas Tydiman with a squadron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to attack them. It is said, that the king of Denmark privately
encouraged this attempt, on condition of sharing the wealthy spoils
of the Hollanders, and that messengers were actually dispatched by
him, bearing orders to the governor of Bergen to afford them no protection.
If this was so, the English admiral, after lying three days
inactive before the bay, ruined the design by a premature attack
upon the fleet ere the royal mandate had arrived, when the Danish
governor took the natural and generous course of vindicating
the neutrality of his harbour, permitted the Dutch to fortify
themselves by erecting batteries on shore, and supported them by
the fire from the castle, which covered the bay. Notwithstanding
this interference of the Danes, which seems to have been unexpected,
the English admiral bore into the bay, commenced the assault
with great fury, and continued it until a contrary wind, joined
to the brave opposition of the Dutch and Danes, obliged him
to desist from the attempt. On this subject, we may, I think, conclude,
that the attack was premature, if the admiral had good reason
to expect the assistance of Denmark, but too long delayed if
he was to depend on his own strength. The scheme is thus satirized
by Rochester:</p>

<p>The famous De Witt set sail at the head of the Dutch fleet in
person, to relieve the ships, which were still detained in Bergen
by the Danish governor. It seems they had found a new enemy
in their old protector, who refused to let them sail, until they
paid a ransom of 100,000 crowns. The arrival of De Witt made
Alfeldt change his note, and the persecuted Hollanders sailed from
their harbour of dubious refuge, at no heavier a composition, than
leaving the cannon, which they had sent ashore, to mount the
land batteries against the English. But in their return, De Witt's
large fleet and valuable cargo were scattered in a storm: the
vice-admiral, and rear-admiral of the East India fleet, ships of
immense value, with several merchant vessels and men of war,
were picked up by the English squadrons, and so furnished the
tribute which Dryden alludes to in this and the following verses.</p>

<p>Tacitus had informed our author, that the German faith was
proverbial, "<i>Nullos mortalium fide aut armis ante Germanos esse</i>."
Bertrand Von Der Ghalen, the warlike Bishop of Munster, whom
the poet pronounces an exception to this honourable distinction
of the Germans, was the only ally of Charles upon the Continent,
during this war. He burst into the United States, at the head of
a mercenary army of 20,000 men. With this force, he over-ran
the province of Overyssell, where his soldiers distinguished themselves
less by military valour, than by an exorbitant licence, rapine,
and cruelty, which did little honour to their reverend general.
But his progress was speedily checked by a French army;
and, as the elector of Brandenburgh threatened his states with invasion,
he found himself compelled to make a separate peace, assigning
as a reason, amongst others, the irregularity of remitting
the promised subsidies from England. This is rather inconsistent
with Dryden's charge, that "money given, had tempted him to
ill;" but in such cases, the party subsidized usually thinks he has
received too little for his service, as those, who pay him, are apt to
suppose he has had too much. Sir William Temple was dispatched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to prevent the Bishop from making the separate peace
here complained of, but he did not arrive till after it had been
signed.</p>

<p>France, unwilling to expose her infant navy in a war with England,
long endeavoured to mediate between the two great maritime
states, and did not undertake to support the Dutch in then
perilous conflict, until all means of negociation had been exhausted,
and the tottering state of Holland rendered immediate aid
necessary. About the same time, Denmark, after much vacillating
and double-handed policy, at length openly united with France
and Holland, against England. The French declaration of war
was made in January 1665-6, and that of Denmark soon afterwards.</p>

<p>By the French declaration of war, all intercourse was prohibited
between the belligerent nations, and the subjects of England were ordered
to leave France. But, in the English counter-declaration, this
usual prohibitory clause was qualified by the king's declaration,
"That all such of the French or Dutch nation remaining in his
dominions, as should demean themselves dutifully, without corresponding
with his enemies, should be safe in their persons and
estates, and free from all molestation and trouble;" and further
the king declared, "That if any of the French or Low Country
subjects upon any reason should come into his kingdoms, they
should be all protected in their persons and estates, and especially
those of the reformed religion, whose interest should ever be
particularly owned by him."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ralph's</span> <cite>History</cite>. Vol. I. p. 159.</p>

the king of their engagement, to assist him with their lives and
fortunes against the Dutch, the address proceeds: "The English
man useth to speak as he writes, and the English parliament, to

engagement of your two houses of parliament. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sed quid verba

And, that your Majesty's occasions may be supplied with ready
money, we have, by the bill, prepared an undoubted security for
all such persons as shall bring their monies unto the public bank
of the Exchequer. As the rivers do naturally empty themselves
unto the sea, so we hope the veins of gold and silver in this nation
will plentifully run into this ocean, for the maintenance of your

<p>The Duke of York being the heir apparent of the crown, it was
not judged proper that he should expose himself in a second sea-fight,
likely to prove as bloody and dangerous as that of the 3d
June 1664. Prince Rupert and the Duke of Albemarle were
appointed to the command of the grand fleet, in the absence of
the Earl of Sandwich, who was then absent, as ambassador in
Spain. These two great men had neither of them been bred to
the sea. Prince Rupert was well known by the distinguished part
which he had taken for his uncle, Charles I., in the great civil war.
When the royal cause became untenable on land, he long endeavoured
to maintain it by sea, assuming for that purpose the command of
the fleet, which had revolted from the Parliament to the Prince of
Wales. The Prince did not relinquish his war against the Commonwealth,
and their Spanish allies, until his whole fleet had been destroyed,
by severe service and tempests. At the period of the Dutch war,
age, and a long train of misfortunes, had chastened the original fire
of his temper, and taught him that prudence, which he wanted in
the civil wars; when, with his impetuous but ill-disciplined cavalry,
he usually bore down all before him, but vanished from the
field in pursuit of the vanquished, leaving his less successful friends
exposed without support. In other respects, he was fitted for a
great commander, both by his natural talents and acquired endowments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and was a great favourite with the nation, because,
though a foreigner, he bore a heart truly English.</p>

<p>George Monk, Duke of Albemarle, the restorer of English monarchy,
united in his person some very different qualities. With
a steady, reserved, and even tardy manner, he was in action
fierce and daring to the last degree; adopting the most desperate
course, with the air and manner of the most cool deliberation.
He had signalized himself against the Dutch, during the
war of the commonwealth, being in the chief command of the fleet,
when they received the dreadful defeat in 1653, to which our
poet alludes in the following lines:</p>

<div class="container">

 <div class="i0">The Duke beheld, like Scipio, with disdain</div>
  <div class="i1">The Carthage which he ruined rise once more;</div>
 <div class="i0">And shook aloft the fasces of the main,</div>
  <div class="i1">To fright those slaves with what they fell before.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Duke accepted the joint command with Prince Rupert, in
1665, much against the advice of his friends, who accounted it
rash in him to stake upon the issue of a battle the well-earned
fame which he had acquired by signal successes in war, and by
accomplishing a mighty revolution without bloodshed. But he
resolved to exert his talents once more for his country in this
trying crisis; a circumstance highly gratifying to the seamen, who
crowded to man the fleet, saying, they were sure, "<i>Honest George
would see them well fed and duly paid</i>;" a compliment more honourable
than many of more courtly expression.</p>

<p>When Prince Rupert and Albemarle were about to sail from
the Downs, they received advice from the king, that the French
had fitted out a strong squadron to join with the Dutch fleet, accompanied
by a positive order, that Prince Rupert, with seventy
men of war, should sail in quest of the French, and fight them before
the intended junction. This order occasioned the separation
of the fleet; a circumstance, which, as the intelligence concerning
the supposed French squadron was totally false, occasioned a
heavy, and, but for the bravery of Albemarle, an overwhelming
disaster. On the first of June, the Duke descried the Dutch fleet,
consisting of seventy six sail, under the famous De Ruyter, whereas
he himself had not above fifty. After calling a council of war,
in which it was agreed in spite of all odds to engage the enemy,
the Duke began the battle, which was continued with incredible
fury during that whole day. The event will be found in the ensuing
notes.</p>

<p>The narrative of this fight, published by authority, has this passage.
"It is certain, that they must every where have suffered a
much greater loss of men than we, from the difference in our manner
of fighting; for they, shooting high, and at a great distance,
damaged us most in our rigging; and we, on the other hand, forbearing
to shoot but when we came near, and then levelling most
at the hulls, must needs have done more execution upon their
men." The Dutch, on the other hand, did great damage to the
rigging of the British squadron by the use of chain-shot, then a
new invention:</p>

Admirals.</p>

<p>"If we had dreaded the number of our enemies, we should have
fled yesterday; but, though we are inferior to them in ships, we are
in all things else superior. Force gives them courage; let us, if we
need it, borrow resolution from the thoughts of what we have formerly
performed. Let the enemy feel, that, though our fleet be
divided, our spirit is entire. At the worst, it will be more honourable
to die bravely in our element, than to be made spectacles
to the Dutch. To be overcome is the fortune of war, but to
fly is the fashion of cowards. Let us teach the world, that Englishmen
had rather be acquainted with death than fear."&mdash;Vol. 2.

<p>The battle was renewed on the second day, with the same desperate
courage, which had distinguished the first battle. The
English <i>charged</i>, as was then the expression, twice through the
whole Dutch fleet, doing and receiving infinite damage. But this
unequal warfare could not last long, "when, at each tack, our little
fleet grew less."</p>

<p>The English had by this time lost, at least, nine vessels sunk and
taken; and Monk bearing away with twenty six, being all that remained
in a condition to fight, was pursued by De Ruyter with
nearly three times that number.</p>

<p>Fire-ships, now only employed against fleets in harbour, and seldom
even then, were at this time used during every great naval
engagement. The Dutch wars, especially, were distinguished by
the frequent use of these dreadful engines of destruction on both
sides. The last instance, I believe, of their being employed in
open sea in the British service, occurred in the engagement of
Matthews and Lestock in the Mediterranean, where they did little
execution. The reason of their disuse appears to be, that modern
fleets consist of a few large vessels, which easily communicate
by signal, and are little apt to fall into such confusion as that fire-ships
can approach them with safety, and with any chance of effect.
In the 17th century, fleets consisted of a very great number
of comparatively small vessels, sometimes a hundred and upwards,
which, from the imperfect nature of their signals, were
perpetually getting into disorder, and affording opportunities for
the fire-ships to act with all their fearful consequences. In the
battle of Southwold Bay, in 1672, the gallant Earl of Sandwich,
in his fine ship the Royal James, after sinking three fire-ships, was
burned by a fourth; and the contest of the Harry with three fire-ships,
in this very battle, will be found in a subsequent note.</p>

<p>Dryden has here inverted the order of the Duke's retreat. His
disabled or shattered ships were all ordered to stretch a-head, and
he himself in the rear, with sixteen of his ablest vessels, his own
occupying the centre, sustained all the efforts of the Dutch pursuers.
The disabled vessels were therefore the headmost ships,
and not placed in the rear, where, in the circumstances, they
must inevitably have been taken.</p>

<p>The English, upon the 3d of June, seemed to have nothing left
them save the glory of a desperate defence, when, about noon, a
third fleet was descried, crowding every sail to the assistance of the
vanquished English, or to complete the triumph of the victorious
Hollanders. It might have been the French squadron under the
Duke of Beaufort, and the naval power of England was ruined
for ever. Albemarle, however, bore boldly down towards the
advancing strangers, and, with inexpressible sensations, discovered
Prince Rupert, with the white squadron of England, hastening to
his relief. Betwixt the fleets of Albemarle and Rupert lay some
dangerous shoals, noticed by Dryden in Stanza 114. On one of
these, called the Galloper, Admiral Sir George Ayscue was so unfortunate
as to strand his vessel, the Royal Prince, one of the largest
in the fleet, and forced by his own seamen to strike his flag.
He was made prisoner by the Dutch, who burned his ship, and,
after leading him in a sort of triumph through various parts of the
United Provinces, at length imprisoned him in the castle of Louverstein.
Albemarle observing the cause of this disaster, and that
the Dutch had sent a squadron of their fleet to the edge of the
sands, as if to provoke the Prince, acquainted him by signal and
message, that he should by no means bear up against that squadron,
there being a dangerous sand between them; and that the
appearance of the Dutch in that place was to tempt him into the
toil. <span class="smcap">Skinner's</span> <cite>Life of Monk</cite>. The English fleets, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
formed a junction, which completed the business of the third day's

<p>On the morning of the 4th of June, this long and bloody contest
was again renewed. The English were now the assailants, as in
the first action. Prince Rupert, with his fresh squadron, led the
van, and was followed by Albemarle. The fleets fought their way
five times through and through each other; when, after much and
desperate fighting on both sides, both the English admirals were
disabled, and the combatants, after four days constant and bloody
fighting, finally separated, as if by mutual consent.</p>

<p>The poet is here more modest than the court of England, who
claimed an absolute victory. Ralph says, with some justice, that
"to recount the precise issue of this unparalleled engagement,
and ascertain the loss on either side, seems to be alike impossible.
Both nations claimed the honour of the victory, and both affronted
the Common Father of the Universe with their impious acknowledgments,
when they ought to have approached Him in
sackcloth and ashes, for having wantonly sacrificed so many innocent,
gallant, and meritorious men, in a dispute that common
sense, and common honesty, might have adjusted in half an
hour." <i>History</i>, Vol. I. p. 132. De Witt himself, the sworn foe
of England, bore the following remarkable testimony to the gallantry
of her seamen: "If the English were beat, their defeat
did them more honour than all their former victories. No fleet
but theirs could, after the first day's fight, have been brought to
engage again. English men may be killed, English ships may be
burned, but English courage is invincible." Quoted, in the "Lives
of the Admirals," from a MS. history by Wicquefort.</p>

<p>The Duke of Albemarle was not more remarkable for bravery
in action, than for his hatred of all corrupt practices in paying
and victualling the navy. His presence accelerated the necessary
repairs, while the sternness of his discipline repressed all those
hateful peculations, by which the servants of the public sometimes
betray their trust, and sap her dearest bulwark. The

<p>It was believed by the ancient chemists, that gold (the noblest of
metals) was formed in the earth by a sort of chemical process,
and might be detected in an imperfect state; in which case the
miner's only resource was to close up the vein, and leave Nature
to perfect the great work. It was this rooted and inveterate belief
which caused so many to give faith to the fable of alchemy.
For, if gold was thus gradually formed in the veins of the earth,
the alchemist had only to discover the process which Nature pursued
in her task, and he obtained the grand secret.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Allen, vice-admiral of the White, and, as I believe,
an old cavalier, opened the war by an action of some consequence
in the Mediterranean. With a squadron of eight or nine ships, he
attacked the Dutch homeward-bound Smyrna fleet, near Cadiz;
consisting of forty merchant vessels, many of which were in these
days capable of a stout resistance, and a convoy of four ships of
war. Allen defeated them totally, killed their commodore, Brackel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
took or sunk four of their richest ships, and drove the rest into the
bay of Cadiz. He commanded the van in the engagement of July
25, 1666.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Holmes, rear-admiral of the White, is called the General's
Achates, from the eager fidelity with which he supported
Albemarle. The injuries which the African company sustained
from the Dutch, and particularly their taking Cape Corfe Castle,
had occasioned Sir Robert Holmes' being dispatched to the coast
of Guinea in 1661, for the purpose of making reprisals. Having
done them some damage on this visit, he returned for the same purpose
in 1663; when he took Goree, and the Dutch merchant-men
lying there, of whom he made prize, though the nations were not
actually at war. He was repulsed from St George Del Mina, the
chief of the Dutch forts on the coast of Africa, but was successful
in taking Cape Corfe, the principal object of his voyage. He
also took from the Dutch a colony in North America, called
Nova Belgia, and bestowed on it the present name of New York.
The Dutch preferred a heavy complaint against Holmes, for these
warlike aggressions. But it would appear, that, if he had exceeded
his instructions, he had not disobliged those by whom they were
given; for, although he was committed to the Tower, he was
speedily liberated, upon pleading, that he had found, on board a
Dutch prize, instructions to seize the English fort at Coromantin.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Spragge, knighted by King Charles, for his gallant
behaviour on the 3d of June 1665, was one of the best and bravest
officers whom the English navy (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Leonum Nutrix</i>) has ever produced.
He distinguished himself in the battle of four days, already
celebrated; and in that of the 25th of July, which Dryden
is proceeding to detail, he carried a flag under Sir Jeremiah Smith,
admiral of the Blue. The brunt of the battle fell upon this division,
because, itself the weakest, it was encountered by that of Van
Tromp, the strongest and best manned squadron of the enemy.
Spragge afterwards distinguished himself by defending Sheerness,
and by chastising the Algerines. But the last scene of his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
crowned all his naval achievements. In the battle of the 11th of
August 1672, Tromp and he engaged like personal enemies, so
that the conflict resembled less a chance rencontre in the confusion
of battle, than a fixed and appointed duel between these
admirals. Both were forced to shift their flag aboard other
vessels, and instantly renewed with the utmost fury their individual
contest. In shifting his flag for the second time, a chance
cannon-ball pierced Sir Edward Spragge's barge, and that gallant
admiral was drowned, to the grief, it is said, of Tromp, his generous
enemy. He left behind him, according to the account both of
friends and foes, the character of one of the bravest men and best
commanders who ever fought at sea; nor was he less lamented by
his friends on shore, for those civilized manners, and that gentle
disposition, which almost always attend enlightened valour.</p>

<p>This alludes to an exploit of Sir John Harman, who commanded
the Henry in the four days combat. He belonged to the Blue
squadron, which broke through the Dutch fleet; but, the Swiftsure
and Essex being taken, his single vessel had great part of the
Zealand division to contend with.&mdash;"His ship being disabled,
the Dutch Admiral, Evertz, called to Sir John, and offered him
quarter, who answered, 'No, sir, it is not come to that yet,'
and immediately discharged a broadside; by which Evertz was
killed, and several of his ships damaged, which so discouraged
their captains, that they quitted the Henry, and sent three fire-ships
to burn her. The first grappled on her starboard quarters,
and there began to arise so thick a smoke, that it was impossible
to perceive where the irons were fixed. At last, when the ship
began to blaze, the boatswain of the Henry threw himself on
board of it, discovered, and removed the grappling irons, and in
the same instant, jumped on board his own ship. He had scarce
done this, before another fire-ship was fixed on the larboard;
this did its business so effectually, that the sails were quickly on
fire, which frightened the chaplain and fifty men over board. Upon
this, Sir John drew his sword, and threatened to kill any man who
should attempt to provide for his own safety, by leaving the ship.
This obliged them to endeavour to put out the fire, which in a
short time they did; but the cordage being burned, the crossbeam
fell down, and broke Sir John's leg; at which instant, the
third fire-ship bore down, but four pieces of cannon, laden with
chain-shot, disabled her. So that, after all, Sir John brought his
ship into Harwich, where he repaired her as well as he could;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>

<p>Sir Frescheville Hollis, mentioned in this verse, was the son of
Frescheville Hollis, of Grimsby, by his second wife, Mrs Elizabeth
Molesworth. His father signalized himself in the civil wars,
as appears from a sign manual of Charles II., dated Jersey, December
4th, 1649, authorising him to bear, <em>or, two piles gules</em>,
quarterly, with his paternal coat, and setting forth,&mdash;that in parliament
he strenuously asserted the king's prerogative; and, being
colonel of a regiment in time of the rebellion, behaved with exemplary
valour against the rebels, in the several battles of Kenton,
Banbury, Brantford, Newark, Atherton, Bradford, and Newbury;
and when the rebels had possessed themselves of the chief places
of England, he with no less fortitude engaged with those that were
besieged by them in Colchester.</p>

<p>How Sir Frescheville Hollis' mother merited the title of a
muse, or by what writings he signalised himself, I am really ignorant.
There were few men of quality who did not at this time
aspire to something of a literary character. As the taste for conceits
began to decay before the turn for ridicule and <em>persiflage</em>,
which characterised the wits of the court of Charles, Dryden was
often ridiculed for the pedigree he has assigned to this literary
champion. Buckingham alludes to it in his "Poetical Reflections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>

<p>The noble author of this flat parody informs us, by marginal
notes, that the "Father Publican" means a committee man, and
adds on the word Hero, "See's Sir <cite>Denzil</cite> Hollis." By which,
by the way, we may notice, that his Grace's accuracy was much
of a piece with his poetry; for the hero's name was Frescheville.</p>

<p>Sir Frescheville Hollis was a man of high spirit and enterprise.
He lost an arm in the great sea-fight of the 3d June,
a circumstance alluded to in the verses. He was Rear-Admiral
of the squadron, with which Sir Robert Holmes attacked the
Dutch Smyrna fleet, near the Isle of Wight, in 1671-2. Finally,
he was killed in the desperate action off Southwould bay, 28th
May, 1672. There is a remarkable passage in his will, made on
the 17th May, 1665; by which, after stating he was going to sea,
as commander of a man-of-war, he directs,&mdash;"In case my body
should be brought to land to be buried, I desire that some stone
may be laid over me, with this inscription:&mdash;Know, reader, whatsoever

<p>The particulars of the memorable engagement, thus introduced
and described in the following stanzas, are thus narrated in the
"Lives of the Admirals." Vol. 11.</p>

<p>"On the 25th of July, about noon, the English came up with
the enemy, off the North-foreland. Sir Thomas Allen with the
White squadron began the battle, by attacking Evertz. Prince
Rupert and the Duke, about one in the afternoon, made a desperate
attack upon de Ruyter, and, after fighting about three
hours, were obliged to go on board another ship. In this space,
the White squadron had entirely defeated their enemies; Admiral
Evertz, his vice-admiral de Vries, and his rear-admiral K&oelig;nders,
being all killed, the vice-admiral of Zealand taken, and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
ship of 50 guns burnt. The prince and duke fought de Ruyter
ship to ship, disabled the Guelderland of 66 guns, which was one
of his seconds, killed the captain of another, and mortally wounded
two more, upon which the Dutch squadron began to fly. However,
vice-admiral Van-Nes stood bravely by de Ruyter, and received
great damage; yet, being at last deserted by all but seven
ships, they yielded to necessity, and followed the rest of their fleet
as fast as they could. De Ruyter's ship was so miserably torn,
and his crew so dispirited and fatigued, that he could have made
but little resistance, and nothing but the want of wind hindered
the English from boarding him. As for admiral Van Tromp, he
was engaged with Sir Jeremiah Smith at a distance, and so could
not assist his friends. As his was the strongest squadron of the
Dutch fleet, and Smith's the weakest of the English, we had not
great advantage on that side; yet some we had, his vice-admiral's
ship being disabled, and his rear-admiral killed; which, however,
did not hinder his fighting it out with much bravery, as long as
there was light.</p>

<p>"Admiral de Ruyter continued his retreat that night, and the
next day Prince Rupert and the Duke of Albemarle pursued him
with part of the Red squadron, as fast as the wind would permit.
A fire-ship bore down upon the Dutch admiral, and missed very
little of setting him on fire. They then cannonaded again, when
de Ruyter found himself so hard pressed, and his fleet in such
eminent danger, that, in a fit of despair, he cried out, 'My God,
what a wretch am I! amongst so many thousand bullets, is not
there one to put me out of my pain?' By degrees, however, he
drew near their own shallow coast, where the English could not
follow him. Upon this occasion, Prince Rupert insulted the
Dutch admiral, by sending a little shallop, called the Fanfan,
with two small guns on board, which, being rowed near de Ruyter's
vessel, fired upon him for two hours together; but at last a
ball from the Dutch admiral so damaged his contemptible enemy,
that the crew were forced to row, and that briskly, to save their
lives. The enemy being driven over the flats into the wylings,
the English went to lie at Schonevelt, the usual rendezvous of the
Dutch fleets."</p>

<p>The battle was fought on the 25th of July, which is the day of
St James, the tutelar saint of Spain. From this circumstance,
the poet takes an opportunity, in the following stanzas, to inculcate
a political doctrine, which the war with Holland and France had
rendered fashionable. It contains an impeachment of the policy
of Queen Elizabeth, who, by supporting the Netherlands against
Philip of Spain, laid, as our author contends, the foundation for
rebellion, and the establishment of a republic in England. The
power of the Spanish monarchy, the poet avers, was slower in
its growth, and a less reasonable object of jealousy to the English,
than the more active and energetic governments of France and
Holland.</p>

into which he was compelled to enter to vindicate his right of succession

<p>Immediately after the battle of the 25th, the victorious fleet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>

and Schelling; for which purpose, a squadron, well manned, and
with a sufficient number of fire-ships, was detached under the
command of Sir Robert Holmes. "On the 8th of July, about
seven in the morning, this squadron weighed, divided from the
rest of the fleet, and came to anchor about a league from the
Buoys, where they met the prince's pleasure-boat, called the
Fanfan, who had discovered in the harbour a considerable number
of ships near the Vlie, which proved to be 170 merchant-ships,
the least of which was not less than 200 ton burden, with two
men of war, which had lately conveyed near a hundred of the
aforesaid ships from the northward, homeward-bound, some from
the Straits, some from Guinea, some from Russia, some from
the East countries; the rest were outward-bound ships, all of
which likewise were very richly laden.</p>

<p>"Sir Robert Holmes, considering that, if he should proceed,
as his design was first, to attempt a descent upon the land, that
numerous fleet might possibly pour in such numbers of men, as
might render the success hazardous, resolved to begin with the
ships; and, accordingly, having ordered the Advice and the Hampshire
to lie without the Buoys, he weighed with the rest of his
fleet; and, the wind being contrary, he turned, with much ado,
into Schelling road, where the Tyger came to anchor, and immediately
Sir Robert went on board the Fanfan, and hoisted his flag,
upon which the officers came on board him, and there it was ordered
that the Pembroke, which drew the least water, with the
fire-ships, should fall in amongst the enemy's fleet, with what
speed they could. Captain Brown, with his fire-ships, chose very
bravely to lay the biggest man of war aboard, and burned him
downright. Another fire-ship, running up at the same time to
the other man of war, he, backing his sails, escaped the present
execution of the fire-ship, but so as to run himself by it on ground,
where he was presently taken by some of the long-boats, and fired.
The other three fire-ships clapped the three great merchant-men
on board, which carried flags in their main-tops, and burned
them. This put their fleet into great confusion, which Sir Robert
Holmes perceiving, made a signal for all the officers to come
on board again, and presently gave orders that Sir William Jennings,
with all the boats that could be spared, should take the
advantage, and fall in, sink, burn, and destroy all they could,
but with a strict command that they should not plunder. The
execution was so well followed, each captain destroying his share,
some twelve, some fifteen merchant-men, that, of the whole fleet,
there escaped not above eight or nine ships, one of which was a
Guinea man of war, of 24 guns, and three small privateers. These
ships, being driven up into a narrower corner of the stream, served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to protect four or five merchant men that were a-head of them,
where it was not possible for our boats to come at them, though
even these few were much damaged.</p>

<p>"The next day, being the 10th of August, it was found more
expedient to land upon the coast of Schelling, than upon Vlie,
which was performed by Sir Robert Holmes, with eleven companies,
in his long-boats, and he landed with little or no opposition.
When he came on shore, he left one company to secure his
boats, and with the other ten marched three miles up into the
country, to the capital town, called Brandaris, in which there
were upwards of a thousand fine houses; where, keeping five
companies upon the skirt of the town, to prevent any surprise of
the enemy, he sent the other five to set fire to the place: But,
finding them somewhat slow to execute that order, and fearing
they might be tempted to forget themselves in the pillage, he was
himself forced to set fire to some houses to the windward, the
sooner to dispatch the work, and hasten his men away, which
burned with such violence, that in half an hour's time most part
of the town was in a light flame. This place was reported, by
those who were found in it, to have been very rich, and so it appeared
by some of the soldiers' pockets; but very few people were
to be seen there, having had time to escape from the danger, except
some old men and women, who were used by the English, after
they fell into their hands, with all possible gentleness and humanity.</p>

<p>"This blow greatly affected the Dutch, who, according to their
own accounts, suffered the loss of near six millions of guilders;
and, if we take the ships into this computation, they confess they
were losers to the amount of eleven millions, or one million, one
hundred thousand pounds sterling."&mdash;<i>Lives of the Admirals</i>, Vol. II.
p. 269, from the account of Sir Robert Holmes.</p>

<p>The dreadful Fire of London befel almost ere the inhabitants
had done with rejoicing over the flames which consumed the fleet
at Vlie, and the town of Brandaris. This horrible conflagration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
took its rise in the house of one Farryner, an obscure baker in
Pudding-lane, near New Fish Street. It broke out on the night
preceding the 2d September, 1666, with astonishing fury; and
the houses in the lane, and its neighbourhood, being entirely constructed
of timber, warped, and dried by a long drought, its progress
was soon so rapid, that the inhabitants were content to escape
from it with their lives, without attempting to save their moveables,
far less to intercept the progress of the conflagration. In
the morning, the attempts to stop a fire, now become so general,
and which raged amidst such combustible buildings, proved totally
ineffectual. The narrowness of the streets, and the nature of the
houses was such, that, where one house was on fire, the devastation
soon became general; and a strong east wind (a Belgian wind,
as Dryden calls it), prevailing through the whole day, the flames,
by various means of approach, occupied and surrounded the
greater part of the city, properly so called. The magazines of
naval stores, pitch, tar, hemp, dried wood, and other materials
for shipping, which occupied the yards by the side of the river,
soon caught the flames, to which they afforded a most horrible
supply of strength and nourishment. All help seemed now to be
in vain; for it is one thing to quench a fire, which has only occupied
a few houses, and against which all the skill and exertion
of those best qualified to check its progress can be at once directed,
and another to extinguish a conflagration which occupies
many streets, and which, if quelled in one spot where skillfully
opposed, is triumphant in many others, where its ravages
are only the object of wonder and lamentation to the heartless
and ignorant citizens. At length universal destruction and dismay
prevented the adoption of uniform or effectual measures against
the destruction which seemed to impend in every quarter. The
progress and extinction of this horrible fire will be learned from
the text, and the following notes.</p>

<p>Dryden, in the hurry of composition, has here made a slight
inaccuracy. It was not Simois, but Xanthus, otherwise called
Scamander, who, having undertaken to drown Achilles, was
nearly dried up by the devouring fires of Vulcan. He called, indeed,

Simois appears to have maintained a prudent neutrality. See the

<p>The king, by his conduct during this emergency, gained more
upon the hearts of his subjects, than by any action of his life.
Completely awakened, by so dreadful an emergence, from his usual
lethargy of pleasure and indolence, he came into the now half-burned
city, with his brother and the nobility, and gave an admirable
specimen of what his character was capable, when in a
state of full exertion. Not contented with passive expressions of
sorrow and sympathy, he issued the most prudent orders, and
animated their execution by his presence. His anxiety was divided
betwixt the task of stopping the conflagration, and the no
less necessary and piteous duty of relieving those thousands, who,
having lost their all by the fire, had neither a morsel of food, nor
a place of shelter. For the one purpose, he spared neither commands,
threats, example, nor liberal rewards, which he lavished
with his own hand; for the other, he opened his naval and military
magazines, and distributed among the miserable and starving
sufferers, the provisions designed for his fleet and army. In fine,
such were his exertions, and so grateful were his people, that
they deemed his presence had an almost supernatural power, and
clamourously entreated not to be deprived of it, when, after the
fire was quenched, he was about to leave London.</p>

<p>"So many houses were now burning together, that water could
not be had in sufficient quantities where it was wanted. The only
remedy left was, to blow up houses at convenient distances from
those which were on fire, and to make, by that means, void spaces,
at which the fury of the conflagration should spend itself for want
of fuel. But this means also proved ineffectual; for the fire, in
some places, made its way by means of the combustible part of
the rubbish of the ruined houses, not well cleared, and in others,
by flakes of burning matter of different kinds, which were carried
through the air, by the impetuous wind, to great distances. And
the city being at that time almost all built of very old timber,
which had besides been parched and scorched by the sun the
whole preceding summer, one of the hottest and dryest that had
been ever known, it came to pass that, wherever such fiery matter
chanced to light, it seldom wanted fit fuel to work and feed

<p>The Duke of York was as active and vigilant as his brother
upon this melancholy occasion. His exertions and seasonable directions,
prevented the fire from breaking out afresh from the
Inner Temple, after it had been got under in other places of the
town. Yet the idle calumny, which stigmatized the Roman
Catholics, as the authors of the conflagration, was often extended
to James himself. In that tissue of falsehood and misrepresentation,
which Titus Oates entitled, "A Picture of the
Late King James," he charges him "with beholding the flames with
joy, and the ruins with much rejoicing," p. 30, and says he would
have impeached him, as an accessary to the raising of that fire, had
he not promised to Prince Rupert to bring forward no accusation
that could hurt the king; "for I could not charge you," says he,
"but must charge him too." In which case, by the way, this
able witness would have made the king accessary to his own murder,
which, according to Oates' own evidence, was to have been
perpetrated during the fire, had not the hearts of the Jesuits failed
them, on seeing the zeal with which he laboured to extinguish it.</p>

<p>In this, and foregoing verses, the miseries of those, whose houses
were consumed, are strikingly painted. Many fled for refuge to the
houses of friends, and lodged there the remnants of their property,
which they had been able to save. These were often forced to
abandon their places of asylum, by a fresh invasion of the devouring
element, and to yield up to its rage all which they had
before rescued. At length, distrusting safety in the city itself, the
villages in its vicinity soon became filled with fugitives, till, in the
end, no place of refuge was left but the open fields, where thousands
remained for several nights, without shelter, watching the
progress of the flames, which were consuming the metropolis.</p>

<p>In 1665, the plague broke out in London with the most dreadful
fury. In one year, upwards of 90,000 inhabitants were cut
off by this frightful visitation. The citizens were driven into the
country, and so desolate was the metropolis, through death and
desertion, that the grass is said actually to have grown in Cheapside.</p>

<p>The poet puts into the prayer of Charles the solemn and striking
choice of David, when, as a penalty for his presumption in
numbering the children of Israel, he was compelled to make an
election between three years famine, three years subjugation to his
enemies, or three days pestilence. "And David said unto God, I
am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the Lord,
for very great are his mercies; but let me not fall into the hand
of man." Dryden had already, in Stanza 265, paraphrased the
patriotic prayer of David: "Let thy hand, I pray thee, O Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
my God, be on me, and on my father's house, but not on thy people,

<p>Waller had addressed a poem to Charles I. upon his Majesty's
repairing St Paul's. Denham, in the commencement of "Cowper's
Hill," alludes both to the labours of the monarch, and of the
poet:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Paul's, the late theme of such a muse, whose flight</div>

  <div class="i0">Secure whilst thee the best of poets sings,</div>
  <div class="i0">Preserved from ruin by the best of kings.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fire of London, however, neither respected the labours of
Charles, the song of Waller, nor the prophecy of Sir John Denham.
During the conflagration, as St Paul's was in an insulated
situation, and constructed of strong stone-work, it was long
thought to be in no danger from the fire, and many of the sufferers
employed it as a place of deposit for the wreck of their goods
and fortunes. But the whole adjoining buildings in the churchyard
being in a light flame, it became impossible, even for the massy
fabric of the cathedral, to resist the combustion. The wood
arches and supports being consumed, the stone-work gave way
with a most horrible crash, and buried the whole edifice in a
pile of smoking ruins.</p>

thirteen thousand two hundred dwelling houses, four hundred

<p>About ten o'clock of the evening of Tuesday the 5th of September,
after the fire had raged for three days, the high east wind,
which had been the means of forcing on its ravages, began to
abate, and, in proportion, the efforts used to stop the progress of
the flames became effectual. In some places, houses being opportunely
blown up prevented the further spreading of the fire;
in others, the flames, spent for lack of fuel, seemed to go out
of themselves. On the morning of the 6th, the conflagration was
totally extinguished.</p>

<p>The prejudices of the times assigned different causes for this tragical
event, according to the political principles of the discordant
parties. Most agreed, that the fire was raised by design; for, although
the multitude are content to allow, that a private person
may die suddenly of a natural disorder, or that a cottage may be
consumed by accidental fire; yet the death of a king, or the conflagration
of a metropolis, must, according to their habits of thinking,
arise from some dark and dismal plot, planned, doubtless, by
those, whose religious or political sentiments are most remote from
their own. The royalists accused the fanatics; the puritans the
papists, of being the raisers of this dreadful fire. Some suspected
even the king and duke of York; though it is somewhat difficult
to see any advantage they could derive from burning a city, which
had been just loading them both with treasures. The Monument,
whose inscription adopts one of these rash opinions, is a
more stately, but not a more respectable, record of prejudice,
than the stone figure in Smithfield, whose tablet declares, the fire
must have been specially and exclusively a judgment for the crime
of <span class="smcap">Gluttony</span>, since it began in <em>Pudding-Lane</em>, and ended in <em>Pye-Corner</em>!</p>

<p>An event so signally calamitous called forth, as may be readily
supposed, the condolence and consolations, such as they were, of
the poets of the day. One author, who designs himself J. A.
Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, poured forth verses "Upon
the late lamentable Fire in London, in an humble imitation of the
most incomparable Mr Cowley his Pindaric strain." This usurper
of the Theban lyre informs us, that</p>

<p>According to the jargon of astrology, a <i>trine</i>, or triangular

mankind. To this Dryden adds the circumstance of the planet
Jove being in his ascension, as a favourable aspect. Our poet was
not above being seriously influenced by these fooleries; and I
dare say will be found, on reference to any almanack of 1666, to
have given a very accurate account of the relative state of the

<p>It is here truly stated, that the calamity of the great fire was
ultimately attended with excellent consequences to the city. By
a proclamation from the king, of an arbitrary and dictatorial nature,
but which the emergency seems to have justified, the citizens
were prohibited from rebuilding their houses, except with solid
materials, and upon such plans as should be set forth by a committee
appointed for the purpose. In this manner, the endless disputes
about property, whose boundaries were now undistinguishable,
were at once silenced, and provision was made for the improvements
in widening the streets, and prohibiting the use of lath
and timber, of which materials the houses were formerly composed.
"Had the king," says Hume, "been enabled to carry his
power still farther, and made the houses be rebuilt with perfect
regularity, and entirely upon one plan, he had contributed much
to the convenience, as well as embellishment, of the city. Great
advantages, however, have resulted from the alterations, though
not carried to the full length. London became much more healthful
after the fire. The plague, which used to break out with great
fury twice or thrice every century, and indeed which was always
lurking in some corner or other of the city, has scarcely ever appeared
since that calamity."&mdash;Vol. VII. p. 4l6.</p>

<h2><a name="ABSALOM_AND_ACHITOPHEL" id="ABSALOM_AND_ACHITOPHEL"></a>ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL.</h2>


<p>The following poem has been uniformly and universally admired,
not only as one of Dryden's most excellent performances, but
as indisputably the best and most nervous political satire that ever
was written. It is said to have been undertaken at the command
of Charles; and if so, no king was ever better obeyed. The general
state of parties in England during the last years of the reign
of Charles II. has been often noticed, particularly in the notes on
"The Duke of Guise," Vol. VI. Shaftesbury, dismissed from the
administration, had bent his whole genius for intrigue, to effect
the exclusion of the Duke of York from the crown of England,
even at the risque of a civil war. Monmouth had thrown himself
into the arms of the same party, flattered by the prospect of
occupying that place from which his uncle was to be excluded.
Every thing seemed to flatter his ambition. The pretensions of
the Duke's daughters must necessarily have been compromised by
the exclusion of their father. At any rate, they were not likely
to be supported by a powerful party, while Monmouth, by his own
personal influence, and that of Shaftesbury, was at the head of all,
whom zeal for religion, disappointed ambition, restlessness of temper,
love of liberty, or desire of licentiousness, had united in opposition
to the measures of the court. Every engine which judgement
or wit could dictate, was employed by either party to place
their cause in the most favourable light, and prejudice that of
their adversaries. Among these, the poem which follows was the
most powerful, and the most successful. The time of its appearance
was chosen with as much art, as the poem displays genius.
Shaftesbury had been committed to the Tower on a charge of high
treason on the 2d July, and the poem was published a few days
before a bill of indictment was presented against him. The sensation
excited by such a poem, at such a time, was intense and
universal.</p>

<p>It has been hitherto generally supposed, that the idea of applying
to Charles and Monmouth the apt characters and story of Absalom
and Achitophel, and indeed the general plan of drawing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
poetical parallel from scriptural history to modern times, was
exclusively our author's. This appears to be a mistake. So far
back as 1679, some favourer of Lord Stafford and of the Catholic
cause ventured to paraphrase the story of Naboth's vineyard, and
to apply it to the condemnation of that unfortunate nobleman for
the Catholic plot. In that piece, the scripture names and characters
are given to the objects of the poet's satire, precisely on the
plan adopted by Dryden in "Absalom and Achitophel,"<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
reader will perceive from the extracts in the note. Not only had
the scheme of a similar poem been conceived, but the very passage
of Scripture, adopted by Dryden as the foundation of his parable,
had been already applied to Charles and his undutiful son.
There appeared, in 1680, a small tract, called "Absalom's Conspiracy,
or the Tragedy of Treason," which, as it seems to have
furnished the general argument of Dryden's poem, and has been
unnoticed by any former commentator, I have subjoined to these
introductory remarks. (See p. 205.)</p>

<p>In a "Letter also to his grace the duke of Monmouth, this 15
July 1680, by a true lover of his person and the peace of the kingdom,"
the same adaptation is thus warmly urged.</p>

<p>"These are the men (speaking of Monmouth's advisers) that
would, with Joab, send for the wise woman to persuade king
David to admit of a return for Absalom his son; and when they
had effected it, leave him to himself, till anger and passion had set
fire to the field of Joab. These are the men, that would have advised
Absalom to make chariots, and to take fifty men to run before
him, and appoint his time and station beside the way of the
gate, to enquire of the tribes of Israel, that came up to the king
for justice, what their controversies and matters were. These are
the men, that would have advised young Absalom, that since David
had appointed no one to hear their grieveances (which was a political
lye), and relieve their oppressions, to wish, "Oh that I were
made judge in the land, that every man that hath any suit or cause
might come to me, and I would do him justice!" In short, these
unprincipled men were they that set on Absalom to steal away the
hearts of the people from the king; these are they, that advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
him to go to Hebron to pay his vow; and these are the men, that
led him into actual rebellion against his father, and to be destroyed
by some of the very hands that had assisted him in those pernicious
counsels." <cite>Somers' Tracts</cite>, p. 111.</p>

<p>The parallel, from its aptness to the circumstances, appears
to have become popular; for Shaftesbury was distinguished by
the nickname of Achitophel<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> before the appearance of the following
poem.</p>

<p>On the merits of Dryden's satire, all critics have been long
agreed. "If it be considered," says Dr Johnson, "as a poem
political and controversial, it will be found to comprise all the
excellencies of which the subject is susceptible; acrimony of censure,
elegance of praise, artful delineation of character, variety
and vigour of sentiment, happy turns of language, and pleasing
harmony of numbers; and all these raised to such a height as can
scarcely be found in any other English composition." The more
deeply we examine the plan of the piece, the more reason we will
find to applaud the exquisite skill of the author. In the character
of Absalom, particularly, he had a delicate task to perform.
He was to draw the misguided and offending son, but not the hardened
reprobate; for Charles, notwithstanding his just indignation,
was to the end of his reign partial to this unfortunate prince,
and anxious to detach him from his desperate counsellors. Dryden
has, accordingly, liberally transferred all the fouler part of
the accusation to the shoulders of Achitophel, while he is tender of
the fame of Absalom. We may suppose, that, in doing so, the poet
indulged his own feelings: the Duchess of Buccleuch had been his
most early patroness, and he had received personal favours from
Monmouth himself,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
These recollections must have had weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with him, when engaged in composing this party poem; and we may
readily believe him, when he affirms, that David could not be
more tender of the young man's life, than he would be of his reputation.
In many of the other characters, that of Buckingham in
particular, a certain degree of mercy is preserved, even amid the
severity of satire. The follies of Zimri are exposed to ridicule;
but his guilt, (and the age accused him of most foul crimes,) is left
in the shade. Even in drawing the character of Achitophel, such
a degree of justice is rendered to his acute talents, and to his merits
as a judge, that we are gained by the poet's apparent candour
to give him credit for the truth of the portrait in its harsher features.
It is remarkable, that the only considerable additions
made to the poem, after the first edition, have a tendency rather
to mollify than to sharpen the satire. The following additional
passage, in the character of Achitophel, stands in this predicament:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">So easy still it proves in factious times,</div>
  <div class="i0">With public zeal to cancel private crimes.</div>
  <div class="i0">How safe is treason, and how sacred ill,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where none can sin against the people's will?</div>
  <div class="i0">Where crowds can wink, and no offence be known,</div>
  <div class="i0">Since in another's guilt they find their own?</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet fame deserved no enemy can grudge;</div>
  <div class="i0">The statesman we abhor, but praise the judge.</div>
  <div class="i0">In Israel's courts ne'er sat an Abethdin</div>
  <div class="i0">With more discerning eyes, or hands more clean,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unbribed, unsought, the wretched to redress;</div>
  <div class="i0">Swift of dispatch, and easy of access.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A report was circulated, and has crept into the "<i>Biographia
Britannica</i>," that this addition was made in consequence of Shaftesbury's
having conferred a favour upon Dryden, and his family,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
in the interval between the first and second edition of "Absalom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and Achitophel;" but this Mr Malone has refuted in the
most satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>A passage, expressive of kind wishes towards Monmouth, was
also added in the second addition:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But oh that yet he would repent and live!</div>
  <div class="i0">How easy 'tis for parents to forgive;</div>
  <div class="i0">With how few tears a pardon might be won,</div>
  <div class="i0">From nature pleading for a darling son!</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These, and other passages, in which Dryden has softened the
severity of his muse, evince not only the poet's taste and judgment,
but that tone of honourable and just feeling, which distinguishes a
true satire from a libellous lampoon.</p>

<p>It was not consistent with Dryden's subject to introduce much
imagery or description into "Absalom and Achitophel;" but,
though Dr Johnson has remarked this as a disadvantage to the poem,
it was, I think, amply compensated by the good effects which the
restraint produced on our author's style of composition. The reader
has already seen in how many instances Dryden gave way to
the false taste of his age, which, indeed, furnished the strongest
temptation to a vigorous mind, naturally delighting to exert
itself in working out an ingenious parallel between remote and
dissimilar ideas. A fiery horse is taught his regular paces by the
restraining discipline of the manege; and, in the same way, the
subject of "Absalom and Achitophel," which confined the poet to
the expression of sentiment and character, and left no room for
excursions into the regions of metaphysical poetry, probably had
the effect of restraining his exertions within the bounds of true
taste, whose precincts he would be less likely to overleap, even
when again turned loose upon a more fanciful theme. It is certain
that "Absalom and Achitophel" is as remarkable for correctness
of taste, as for fire and spirit of composition; nor ought the reader,
amidst so many appropriate beauties, to regret those flights
of imagination, which could not have been indulged without impropriety.</p>

<p>Another objection, stated to this poem, has been the abrupt
and unsatisfactory nature of the conclusion. The factions, and
their leaders, are described; and, when our expectation is at the
highest, the danger is at once dispelled by a speech from the
throne. "Who," says Johnson, "can forbear to think of an enchanted
castle, with a wide moat, and lofty battlements, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
vanishes at once into air, when the destined knight blows his horn
before it." Yet, with great deference to such authority, it may
be considered as somewhat hard to expect the merit of a well-conducted
story in a poem merely intended as a designation of various
living characters. He, who collects a gallery of portraits, disclaims,
by the very act of doing so, any intention of presenting a series of
historical events. Each separate style of poetry has its merits and
disadvantages, but we should not expect a historical work to contain
the poignancy of a satire, or a satire to exhibit the majestic
and interesting story of an epic poem. Besides, there had actually
been an important crisis, and highly favourable to the court, produced
by the king's behaviour at Oxford, and by the sudden dissolution
of that parliament, which, according to Shaftesbury, was
to have rendered the Duke of York as abandoned an exile as the
first murderer Cain. This stroke of power was executed so unexpectedly,
that the Commons had not the slightest suspicion of
what was intended, till they were summoned by the Black Rod to
attend the king. Oxford, so lately crowded with the armed factionaries
and partizans of royalty and democracy, was at once deserted,
and left to its usual stillness and seclusion. The blow was
fatal to the country party, as it dispersed that body in which they
had knit up their strength, and which alone could give their proceedings
the sanction of law.</p>

<p>The success of "Absalom and Achitophel" was unexampled. Dr
Johnson's father, a bookseller, told him, it was exceeded by nothing
in his remembrance, excepting that of Sacheverel's Sermon.
The allusions which it contained became universally known; and
the allegorical names seemed to be inalienably entailed upon the
persons to whom Dryden had assigned them. Not only were they
in perpetual use amongst the court poets of the day,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
parable was repeatedly inculcated and preached upon from the pulpit,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
and echoed and re-echoed in all the addresses of the time.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The poem was at first published without a name, a circumstance
which must have added to the curiosity of the public; there were,
however, few writers, save the author, who could be suspected
even for a moment, and it is probable he did not remain long
concealed. The poem was published on the 17th November,
1681,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and, as early as the 10th of December, Dryden is attacked
as the author, in a miserable Grubstreet poem, called "Towser
the Second," supposed to be written by Henry Care.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Then
came forth, on the 14th, His Grace of Buckingham's "Poetical
Reflections," which are amply analysed in our notes. A non-conformist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
clergyman (name unknown) advanced to the charge on
the 25th, with a pamphlet termed, "A Whip for the Fool's Back;"
and followed it up with the "Key with the Whip, to open the
mystery and iniquity of the poem called Absalom and Achitophel."
Then Samuel Pordage published "Azariah and Hushai;"
and, finally, our author's old antagonist, Elkanah Settle, brought
up the heavy rear with a ponderous pamphlet entitled, "Absalom
Senior; or, Achitophel Transposed, a Poem." All these laborious
and indignant vindications and rebutters served only to shew
how much the faction was hurt by this spirited satire, and how
unable they were to make an effectual retort. Were we to judge
of their strength in other respects, from the efforts of their writers,
we should esteem them very unworthy of Dryden's satire, and exclaim,
as Tybalt does to Benvolio,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">What dost thou, drawn, among these heartless hinds?</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, Dryden takes but slight and contemptuous notice
of any of his antagonists, save Shadwell and Settle, on whom he
inflicts a severe flagellation in the Second Part. On the other
hand, Nahum Tate, and other tory poets, came forth with congratulatory
verses, the inferiority of which served to shew that Dryden's
force did not lie in the principles and subject which he had in
common with these poetasters, but in the incommunicable resources
of his own genius.</p>

<p>The first part of "Absalom and Achitophel" is in folio, "Printed
for J. T. (Jacob Tonson) and are to be sold by W. Davis, in Amen
corner, 1681." A second edition was issued before the end of
December, which was followed by many more. Mr Malone believes
that the edition which appeared in the Miscellanies was the
sixth; and a quarto copy, now before me, dated 1692, calls itself
"the Seventh Edition, augmented and revised." Two Latin
versions of "Absalom and Achitophel" were executed; one by the
famous Atterbury, afterwards bishop of Rochester, the other by
Dr Coward.</p>

in the Harleian Miscellany.</p>

<p>"There is nothing so dangerous either to societies in general, or
to particular persons, as ambition; the temptations of sovereignty,
and the glittering lustre of a crown, have been guilty of all the
fearful consequences that can be within the compass of imagination.
For this, mighty nations have been drowned in blood, populous
cities have been made, desolate, laid in ashes, and left without
inhabitants; for this, parents have lost all the sense and tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of nature; and children, all the sentiments of duty and obedience;
the eternal laws of good and just, the laws of nature and of nations,
of God and religion, have been violated; men have been
transformed into the cruelty of beasts, and into the rage and malice
of devils.</p>

<p>"Instances, both modern and ancient, of this, are innumerable;
but this of Absalom is a tragedy, whose antiquity and truth do
equally recommend it as an example to all posterity, and a caution
to all mankind, to take care how they embark in ambitious
and unlawful designs; and it is a particular caveat to all young
men, to beware of such counsellors as the old Achitophel, lest,
while they are tempted with the hopes of a crown, they hasten on
their own destiny, and come to an untimely end.</p>

<p>"Absalom was the third son of David by Maachah, the daughter
of Talmai, king of Geshur, who was one of David's concubines;
he, seeing his title to the crown upon the score of lawful succession
would not do, resolved to make good what was defective in it by
open force, by dethroning his father.</p>

<p>"Now the arts he used to accomplish his design were these.
First, he studied popularity; he rose up early, he was industrious
and diligent in his way; he placed himself in the way of the gate;
and when any man came for judgment, he courteously entered
into discourse with him. This feigned condescension was the first
step of his ambition. Secondly, he depraved his father's government:
the king was careless, drowned in his pleasures; the counsellors
were evil; no man regarded the petitioners: Absalom said
unto him,&mdash;See, thy matters are good and right, it is but reason that
you petition for; but there is no man that will hear thee from the
king; there is no justice to be found, your petitions are rejected.
Thirdly, he insinuates what he would do if he were in authority;
how easy access should be to him; he would do them justice; he
would hear and redress their grievances, receive their petitions,
and give them gracious answers:&mdash;Oh that I were made judge in
the land, that every man might come unto me, and I would do him
justice! And, when any man came to do him obeysance, he put
forth his hand, and took him and kissed him; and thus he stole
away the hearts of the people from their lawful king, his father
and sovereign.</p>

<p>"But all this would not do; he therefore joins himself to one
Achitophel, an old man of a shrewd head, and discontented heart.
This Achitophel, it seems, had been a great counsellor of David's;
but was now under some disgrace, as appears by Absalom's sending
for him from Gilo, his city, whither he was in discontent retreated,
because David had advanced Hushai into his privy-council;
and no doubt can be made, but he was of the conspiracy before,
by his ready joining with Absalom as soon as the matters
were ripe for execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Absalom having thus laid his train, and made secret provision
for his intended rebellion, dispatches his emissaries abroad, to give
notice by his spies, that all the confederates should be ready at
the sound of the trumpet, and say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron;
and immediately a great multitude was gathered to him; for the
conspiracy was strong; some went out of malice, and some in their
simplicity followed him, and knew not any thing.</p>

<p>"David is forced to fly from his son, but still he had a loyal
party that stuck close to him. Achitophel gave devilish counsel,
but God disappointed it strangely; for Hushai, pretending to come
over to their party, put Absalom upon a plausible expedient,
which proved his ruin. So impossible is it for treason to be secure,
that no person who forms a conspiracy, but there may be
some, who, under pretence of the greatest kindness, may insinuate
themselves, only to discover their secrets, and ruin their intentions,
either by revealing their treason, or disappointing it; and certainly,
of all men, traitors are least to be trusted; for they who can
be perfidious to one, can never be true to any.</p>

<p>"The matter comes at last to the decision of the sword. Absalom's
party are defeated, and many slain, and Absalom himself,
seeking to save himself by flight in the wood, is entangled in a tree
by his own hair, which was his pride; and his mule going from
under him, there left him hanging till Joab came, and, with three
darts, made at once an end of his life and the rebellion. Thus
ended his youthful and foolish ambition, making him an eternal
monument of infamy, and an instance of the justice of divine vengeance,
and what will be the conclusion of ambition, treason, and
conspiracy, against lawful kings and governors: A severe admonition
to all green heads, to avoid the temptations of grey Achitophels.</p>

<p>"Achitophel, the engineer of all this mischief, seeing his counsel
despised, and foreseeing the event, prevented the hand of the executioner,
and, in revenge upon himself, went home and hanged
himself; give fair warning to all treacherous counsellors, to see
what their devilish counsels will lead them to at last; mischievous
counsel ever falling in conclusion upon the heads where first it was
contrived, as naturally as dirty kennels fall into the common-sewer.</p>

<p>"Whatsoever was written aforetime, was written for our instruction:
for holy men of God spake as they were moved by the
Holy Ghost."</p>

THE READER.</h2>


<p><span class="fontsize">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is not my intention to make an apology for my
poem; some will think it needs no excuse, and
others will receive none. The design I am sure is
honest; but he who draws his pen for one party,
must expect to make enemies of the other. For
wit and fool, are consequents of Whig and Tory;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and every man is a knave or an ass to the contrary
side. There is a treasury of merits in the fanatic
church, as well as in the popish; and a pennyworth
to be had of saintship, honesty, and poetry, for the
lewd, the factious, and the blockheads; but the
longest chapter in Deuteronomy has not curses
enough for an Anti-Bromingham.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> My comfort is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
their manifest prejudice to my cause will render
their judgment of less authority against me. Yet, if
a poem have genius, it will force its own reception
in the world; for there is a sweetness in good
verse, which tickles even while it hurts; and no
man can be heartily angry with him who pleases
him against his will. The commendation of adversaries
is the greatest triumph of a writer, because
it never comes unless extorted. But I can be satisfied
on more easy terms; if I happen to please the
more moderate sort, I shall be sure of an honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
party, and, in all probability, of the best judges;
for the least concerned are commonly the least corrupt.
And I confess I have laid in for those, by
rebating the satire, where justice would allow it,
from carrying too sharp an edge. They who can
criticise so weakly, as to imagine I have done my
worst, may be convinced, at their own cost, that I
can write severely, with more ease than I can gently.
I have but laughed at some men's follies, when
I could have declaimed against their vices; and
other men's virtues I have commended, as freely as
I have taxed their crimes. And now, if you are a
malicious reader, I expect you should return upon
me, that I affect to be thought more impartial than
I am; but if men are not to be judged by their professions,
God forgive you commonwealth's-men for
professing so plausibly for the government! You
cannot be so unconscionable as to charge me for
not subscribing my name; for that would reflect
too grossly upon your own party, who never dare,
though they have the advantage of a jury to secure
them. If you like not my poem, the fault may possibly
be in my writing; though it is hard for an author
to judge against himself: but more probably
it is in your morals, which cannot bear the truth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
it. The violent on both sides will condemn the
character of Absalom, as either too favourably or too
hardly drawn. But they are not the violent whom
I desire to please. The fault on the right hand is
to extenuate, palliate, and indulge; and, to confess
freely, I have endeavoured to commit it. Besides
the respect which I owe his birth, I have a greater
for his heroic virtues; and David himself could not
be more tender of the young man's life, than I would
be of his reputation. But since the most excellent
natures are always the most easy, and, as being such,
are the soonest perverted by ill counsels, especially
when baited with fame and glory, it is no more a
wonder that he withstood not the temptations of
Achitophel, than it was for Adam not to have resisted
the two devils, the serpent and the woman.
The conclusion of the story I purposely forbore to
prosecute, because I could not obtain from myself
to shew Absalom unfortunate. The frame of it was
cut out but for a picture to the waist; and if the
draught be so far true, it is as much as I designed.</p>

<p>Were I the inventor, who am only the historian,
I should certainly conclude the piece, with the reconcilement
of Absalom to David. And who
knows but this may come to pass? Things were
not brought to an extremity where I left the story;
there seems yet to be room left for a composure;
hereafter there may be only for pity. I have not
so much as an uncharitable wish against Achitophel,
but am content to be accused of a good-natured
error, and to hope with Origen, that the devil
himself may at last be saved. For which reason, in
this poem, he is neither brought to set his house in
order, nor to dispose of his person afterwards as he
in wisdom shall think fit. God is infinitely merciful;
and his vicegerent is only not so, because he is
not infinite.</p>

<p>The true end of satire is the amendment of vices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
by correction. And he, who writes honestly, is no
more an enemy to the offender, than the physician
to the patient, when he prescribes harsh remedies
to an inveterate disease; for those are only in order
to prevent the chirurgeon's work of an <i>Ense rescindendum</i>,
which I wish not to my very enemies. To
conclude all; if the body politic have any analogy
to the natural, in my weak judgment, an act of oblivion
were as necessary in a hot distempered state,
as an opiate would be in a raging fever.</p>

<h3>RECOMMENDATORY VERSES.</h3>

<p>The following Recommendatory Verses, Dryden thought worthy
of being prefixed to the later editions of his "Absalom and
Achitophel," for which reason they are here retained. It will be
observed, that they all mention the author as unknown. This,
however, we are not to understand literally; since it is obvious,
from the contemporary libels, that Dryden was well known for
the author. But, till he placed his name in the title page, his
friends were not to affect to know more than that told them; as
it is impolite to recognize a person who affects a disguise.</p>

  <div class="i0">Those very Jews, who at their very best,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their humour more than loyalty exprest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Now wondered why so long they had obeyed</div>
  <div class="i0">An idol monarch, which their hands had made;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thought they might ruin him they could create,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or melt him to that golden calf,&mdash;a state.</div>
  <div class="i0">But these were random bolts; no formed design,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor interest made the factious crowd to join:</div>
  <div class="i0">The sober part of Israel, free from stain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Well knew the value of a peaceful reign;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, looking backward with a wise affright,</div>
  <div class="i0">Saw seams of wounds dishonest to the sight;</div>
  <div class="i0">In contemplation of whose ugly scars,</div>
  <div class="i0">They curst the memory of civil wars.</div>
  <div class="i0">The moderate sort of men, thus qualified,</div>
  <div class="i0">Inclined the balance to the better side;</div>
  <div class="i0">And David's mildness managed it so well,</div>
  <div class="i0">The bad found no occasion to rebel.</div>
  <div class="i0">But when to sin our biassed nature leans,</div>
  <div class="i0">The careful devil is still at hand with means,</div>
  <div class="i0">And providently pimps for ill desires;</div>
  <div class="i0">The good old cause, revived, a plot requires.</div>
  <div class="i0">Plots, true or false, are necessary things,</div>
  <div class="i0">To raise up commonwealths, and ruin kings.</div>

  <div class="i0">Such savoury deities must needs be good,</div>

  <div class="i0">By force they could not introduce these gods,&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade.</div>
  <div class="i0">Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews,</div>

  <div class="i0">Some thought they God's anointed meant to slay</div>

  <div class="i0">Some had in courts been great, and, thrown from thence,</div>

  <div class="i0">For all beyond it is to touch the ark.</div>
  <div class="i0">To change foundations, cast the frame anew,</div>

<p>Queen Catherine of Portugal, the wife of Charles II., resembled
the daughter of Saul in the circumstance mentioned in the text.
She was plain in her person, and consequently possessed little influence
over her gallant husband. She was, however, always
treated by him with decent civility; and indeed, when persecuted
by the popular party, experienced his warmest protection. Her
greatest fault was her being educated a Catholic; her greatest
misfortune, her bearing the king no children; and her greatest
foible an excessive love of dancing. It might have occurred to
the good people of these times, that loving a ball was not a capital
sin, even in a person whose figure excluded her from the hopes of
gracing it; that a princess of Portugal must be a Catholic, if she
had any religion at all; and, finally, that to bear children, it is
necessary some one should take the trouble of getting them. But
these obvious considerations did not prevent her being grossly
abused in the libels of the times,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and very nearly made a party

mentioned, he had a daughter by Lady Shannon, and the
Earl of Plymouth by Mrs Catherine Pegge; by the Duchess of
Cleveland he had the Dukes of Cleveland, Gratton, and Northumberland,

<p>James Stuart, Duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch, was born at
Rotterdam, 9th April, 1649, in the very heat of the civil wars.
He was the son of Charles II. and Mrs Lucy Walters, or Waters,
otherwise called Barlow, a beautiful young lady, of a good Welch
family. He was educated privately in Holland, under the assumed
name of James Crofts; and the respect with which his mother
and he were treated by the cavalier, afforded a foundation
for the argument of his adherents, who afterwards contended, that
the king had been privately married to that lady. After the Restoration,
the king sent for this young gentleman to court, where
the royal favour and his own personal and acquired accomplishments
soon made him very remarkable. Of his outward appearance,
Count Hamilton, the gay recorder of the gaieties of the
court of Charles, has given us a most interesting description,
which is not belied by portraits which are still preserved. "Nature,"
says the count, "perhaps never formed any thing so perfect
as the external graces of his person." His face was beautiful;
but it was a masculine beauty, unmixed with any thing weak or
effeminate: each feature had its own peculiar and interesting turn
of expression. He had admirable address in all active exercises,
an attractive manner, and an air of princely majesty. Yet his
mental qualities did not altogether support this prepossessing exterior;
or rather his fate plunged him into scenes where more was
necessary than the mind and manners which, in more regular
times, would have distinguished him as an accomplished cavalier
in peace and war. He was married, by the king's interference, to
Anne Scott, Countess of Buccleuch, sole surviving child of Francis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Earl of Buccleuch, and heiress of the extensive estate which
the powerful family she represented had acquired on the frontiers
of Scotland. The young prince had been previously created Duke
of Orkney, a title now changed for that of Monmouth; and the
king, upon his marriage, added to his honours the dukedom of
Buccleuch. Thus favoured at home, he was also fortunate enough
to have an opportunity of acquiring military fame, by serving two
campaigns as a volunteer in Louis XIV.'s army against the Dutch.
He particularly distinguished himself at the siege of Maestricht,
where he led the storming party, took possession of the counterscarp,
and made good his quarters against the repeated and desperate
attempts of the besieged to dislodge him. Monmouth also
served a campaign with the Dutch against the French, in 1678, and is
on all hands allowed to have displayed great personal bravery; especially
in the famous attack on the Duke of Luxemburgh's line
before Mons, when the Prince of Orange, whose judgment can
hardly be doubted, formed that good opinion of his military skill,
which he stated when he offered to command the forces of his
father-in-law against the Duke on his last unfortunate expedition.
With that renown which is so willingly conferred upon the noble
and the beautiful, the Duke returned to England, and met with a
distinguished reception from Charles, by whom he was loaded with
favours, as will appear from the following list of his titles and offices.</p>

<p>He was Duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch; Earl of Doncaster
and Dalkeith; Lord Scott of Tinedale, Whichester, and Eskdale;
Lord Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Lord-Lieutenant of the east
Riding of Yorkshire; Governor of the town and citadel of Kingston
upon Hull; Chief Justice in Eyre of all his Majesty's forests,
chases, parks, and warrens on the south side of the Trent; Lord-General
of all his Majesty's land forces; Captain of his Majesty's
Life-guards of horse; Chancellor of the university of Cambridge;
Master of horse to the King; one of the Lords of the Privy Council,
and Knight of the order of the Garter.</p>

<p>Thus highly distinguished by rank, reputation, and royal favour,
he appears for some time to have dedicated himself chiefly
to the pleasures of the court, when an unfortunate quarrel with
the Duke of York, in the rivalry of an intrigue,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> laid the foundation
for that difference, which was one great means of embroiling
the latter years of Charles's reign, and finally cost Monmouth his
head. When his quarrel with his uncle, whose unforgiving temper
was well known, had become inveterate and irreconcileable, the
Duke of Monmouth was led to head the faction most inimical to the
interests of York, and speedily became distinguished by the name of
the Protestant Duke, the dearest title that his party could bestow.
The prospect which now opened itself before Monmouth was such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
as might have turned the head of a man of deeper political capacity.
The heir apparent, his personal enemy, had become the object
of popular hatred to such a degree, that the bill, excluding
him from the succession, seemed to have every chance of being
carried through the House of Lords, as it had already passed the
Commons. The rights of the Queen were not likely to interest
any one; and it seems generally to have been believed, however
unjustly as it proved, that Charles was too fond of Monmouth, too
jealous of his brother, and too little scrupulous of ways and means,
to hesitate at declaring this favourite youth his legitimate successor.</p>

<p>Under such favourable circumstances, it is no wonder that
Monmouth gave way to the dictates of ambition; and while he
probably conceived that he was only giving his father an opportunity
to manifest his secret partiality, he became more and more
deeply involved in the plots of Shaftesbury, whose bustling and
intriguing spirit saw at once the use to be made of Monmouth's
favour with the king, and popularity with the public. From that
time, their union became close and inseparable; even while Shaftesbury
was yet a member of the king's administration. Their
meetings were conducted with a secrecy and mystery which argued
their importance. According to Carte, they were held at
Lord Shaftesbury's and Charleton's houses, both parties coming
in private, and in hackney coaches. Some of Monmouth's partizans
had even the boldness to assert the legitimacy of their patron,
to prepare for his supplanting the Duke of York. When the
insurrection of the Covenanters broke out in Scotland, Monmouth
was employed against them, a duty which he executed with fidelity
and success. He completely defeated the insurgents in the
battle of Bothwell Bridge, and returned to the court in all the
freshness of his laurels. This was in the year 1679, and Monmouth's
good fortune had then attained its summit. He was beloved
by the people, general of all the forces both in England and
Scotland; London was at the devotion of Shaftesbury, the Duke
of York banished to Brussels, and universally detested on account
of his religion. At this important moment Charles fell ill of a
fever at Windsor. Had he died it is very probable that Monmouth
would have found himself in a condition to agitate successfully
a title to the crown. But either the king's attachment
to the Catholic religion, in the profession of which he finally died,
or his sense of justice and hereditary right occasioned an extraordinary
alteration of measures at this momentous crisis. The
Duke of York was summoned from abroad, arrived at Windsor,
and by his presence and activity at once resumed that ascendance
over Charles, which his more stern genius had always possessed,
and animated the sunken spirit of his own partizans. By a most sudden
and surprising revolution, York was restored to all his brother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
favour. For although he was obliged to retire to Scotland to avoid
the fury of the exclusionists, yet a sharper exile awaited his rival
Monmouth, who, deprived of all his offices, was sent into the foreign
banishment from which his uncle had just been recalled.
Accordingly he retired to Holland, where he was courteously received
by the States; and where Charles himself appears to have
been desirous, that his darling son should find an honourable asylum.
Meanwhile the factions waxed still more furious; and
Shaftesbury, whose boast it was to "ride in the whirlwind and direct
the storm," utterly embroiled the kingdom, by persuading
Monmouth to return to England without licence from his father,
and to furnish an ostensible head to that body of which the wily
politician was himself the soul. This conduct deeply injured Monmouth
in his father's favour, who refused to see him; and, by an
enquiry and subsequent declaration made openly in council, and
published in the Gazette, endeavoured to put an end to his hopes,
by publicly declaring his illegitimacy. Wonderful as it may seem,
this avowal was ascribed to the king's fear for his brother; and
two daring pamphlets were actually published, to assert the legitimacy
of Monmouth, against the express and solemn declaration
of his father.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Monmouth himself, by various progresses
through the kingdom, with an affectation of popularity which
gained the vulgar but terrified the reflecting, above all, by a
close alliance with the Machiavel, Shaftesbury, shewed his avowed
determination to maintain his pretensions against those of the lawful
successor. This was the state of parties in 1681, when "Absalom
and Achitophel" first appeared.</p>

<p>The permission of so sharp a satire against the party of Monmouth,
though much qualified as to his individual person, plainly
shewed the king's intention to proceed with energy against the
country party. Monmouth, in the midst of one of those splendid
journies which he had made to display his strength, was arrested
at Stafford, September 20, 1682, and obliged to enter bail for his
peaceable deportment and appearance when called on, to answer
any suit against him by the king. In the mean while, the dubious
and mysterious cabal, called the Rye-house Plot, was concocted by
two separate parties, moving in some degree towards the same
point, but actuated by very different motives, adopting different
modes of conduct, and in their mutual intrigues but slightly connected
with each other. It appears certain, that Monmouth utterly
abominated the proposal of Rumbold, and those who made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the assassination of the King and Duke of York the groundwork of
their proposed insurrection. It is equally certain, that, with Sidney
and Russell, he engaged in plans of reformation, or revolution,
of that dubious description, which might have turned out good or
evil, according to their power of managing the machine they were
about to set in motion; a power almost always over-rated till
the awful moment of experiment. Upon the discovery of these
proceedings, Monmouth absconded, but generously signified to
Lord Russell his determination to surrender himself if it could
serve his friend; an offer which Russell, with the same generosity,
positively rejected.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the discovery which involved perhaps a charge
of high treason, the king was so much convinced of Monmouth's
innocence, so far as the safety of his person was concerned, that
the influence of Halifax, who always strove to balance the power
of the Duke of York by that of his nephew, procured him an opportunity
of being restored to the king's favour, for which the minister
had little thanks from the heir of the crown.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> But Monmouth,
by an excess of imprudence, in which, however, he displayed
a noble spirit, forfeited the advantages he might have obtained
at this crisis. Although he signed an acknowledgment of
his guilt, in listening to counsels which could not be carried into
effect, without a restraint on the king's person; he would not, on
reflection, authorize the publication of a declaration, which must
have had a fatal influence on the impending trial of his friends.
He demanded it back, and received it; but accompanied with an
order to leave the kingdom. He obeyed, and remained in honourable
banishment in Holland, till after the accession of James
II. to the throne. There is room to believe, that Monmouth
would never have disturbed his uncle, had James not evinced a
desire to follow him with vengeance even into his retreat. Wellwood
has published a letter from him, in which he says, ambition is
mortified within him, and expresses himself determined to live in retirement.
But when the King insisted on the Prince of Orange driving
him out of Holland, and proceeded to take measures to exclude
him from Brussels, he appears to have become desperate. Even yet
he prepared to retire to Sweden, but he was surrounded by fugitives
from England and Scotland, who, as is always the case, represented
the nation as agitated by their passions, and feeling for their
individual oppression: Argyle, in particular, and the Scottish exiles,
fired by the aggressions on their liberty and religion, anticipated
a more warm support than they afterwards experienced.</p>

<p>Monmouth, thus driven upon his fate, set sail with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
ships; landed at Lyme with hardly an hundred followers; and,
such was the magic of his popularity, soon found himself at
the head of a considerable force. He baffled the Duke of
Albemarle who attempted to coop him up at Lyme, and, advancing
to Taunton took upon him fatally the title of King. At
length, he surprised the Earl of Feversham, James's general, in
his entrenchments near Bridgewater; and the native stubborn valour
of his followers nearly proved too much for the discipline of
the veterans, whom they attacked. The cowardice of Lord Grey,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
who fled with the cavalry, led to a total defeat and much slaughter
among Monmouth's forces. Still more fell a sacrifice to the bloody
zeal of the brutal Jefferies. The Duke himself was taken in his flight;
and, depressed by fatigue and disappointment, shewed some symptoms
of weakness, inconsistent with his former character. He solicited
his life by submissive letters to James, and, at length, obtained
an interview with the king. But James forgot the noble,
though homely popular saying,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A king's face</div>
  <div class="i0">Should give grace.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With the natural sternness of his character, he only strove to extort
from Monmouth a disavowal of his legitimacy, and a confession
of his accomplices. To the former the Duke submitted; but,
when urged to the latter, rose from the posture of supplication,
and retorted with dignity the reproaches of James. When he returned
to the Tower, he wrote a letter to the king, supposed
to contain a secret, the revealing of which might have purchased
his life. This letter he intrusted to Captain Scott of
Dumbarton's regiment, a descendant of the family of Harden, and,
consequently, related to the Duchess of Monmouth. The famous
Blood is said to have compelled Scott to deliver up the letter,
and carried it to Sunderland, who destroyed it.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Monmouth, finding all efforts to procure a pardon
ineffectual, met death with great resolution. He smiled on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
guards who surrounded the scaffold, and whom in his better days
he had commanded; bowed to the populace, who expressed by
sighs and tears their interest in his fate; and submitted to his doom.
His death was cruelly prolonged by the hesitation of the executioner,
who, after several ineffectual strokes of the axe, threw
it down, and could scarcely be prevailed on to finish his bloody
work. The execution took place on the 15th of July, 1685.</p>

<p>It would be difficult, were it here necessary, to draw a character
of the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth. His qualities and
accomplishments were fitted for times more gentle than those in
which he lived, where he might be compared to a pleasure barge
struggling against a hurricane. In gentler times, he had proved
a successful leader in war; and in peace, what the reviver of tragedy
has aptly stiled, "An honoured courtly gentleman." <cite>Count
Basil</cite>. Act I. Scene II.</p>

<p>Anne, Duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth, a lady of high
spirit, great beauty, and unimpeachable honour. We have had
repeated occasion to mention her in the course of these notes.
She was reckoned the richest heiress in Europe; as, upon the death
of her elder sister, Anne Countess of Buccleuch, wife of Walter
Earl of Tarras, she succeeded to the extensive land estate of that
family. Charles made this advantageous match for his son, by the
intervention of the young lady's mother, the Countess of Wemyss.
The Duchess of Buccleuch was a distinguished protectress of
poetical merit, and evinced her discriminating taste, by early selecting
Dryden as the object of her patronage; she cultivated the
friendship of the Duke of York, and established an intimacy between
him and her husband, which paved the way for the advancement
of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> When by an occasional rivalry they
quarrelled, and became irreconcileable enemies, she still opposed
her prudence to the precipitate counsels of Monmouth's
worse advisers. It is probable her influence saved his life, by determining
him to make a timely confession, concerning all he knew
of the Rye-house conspiracy, upon condition, it was not to be
used against his friends. When he imprudently retracted that
confession, her advice prevailed on him to offer a renewal of
it.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Their last interview before the Duke's execution, is thus
narrated in a MS. now before me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"His behaviour all the time was brave and unmoved, and,
even during the last conversation and farewell with his lady and
children, which was the movingest scene in the world, and which
no bye-standers could see without melting in tears, he did not shew
the least concerndness. He declared before all the company, how
averse the duchess had been to all his irregular courses, and that
she had never been uneasy to him on any occasion whatsoever,
but about women, and his failing of dutie to the late king. And
that she knew nothing of his last designe, not having heard from
himself a year before, which was his own fault, and noe unkindness
in her, because she knew not how to direct her letters to him.
In that, he gave her the kyndest character that could be, and begged
her pardon of his many failings and offences to her, and prayed
her to continue her kyndness and care to her poore children.
At this expression she fell down on her knees, with her eyes full of
teares, and begged him to pardon her if ever she had done any
thing to offend and displease him; and embracing his knees, fell
into a swoon, out of which they had much adoe to raise her up
in a good while after. A little before, his children were brought
to him, all crying about him; but he acquitted himself of these
last adewes with much composure, shewing nothing of weakness
and unmanliness." <i>Account of the Actions and Behaviour of the
Duke of Monmouth, from the time he was taken to his Execution,
in a letter, dated July 16, 1685, MS.</i>, in the Duke of Buccleuch's
library.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Monmouth's turn of mind, and her aversion to
her husband's political intrigues, lead me to imagine, that Dryden
sketched out her character under that of Marmoutiere in "the
Duke of Guise;" whose expostulations with her lover apply exactly
to the situation of this noble pair. If the Duke of Monmouth
entertained a causeless jealousy of the intimacy of York with
his lady, as the Duke of Buckingham seems to hint,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> something
like an allusion to this circumstance may be traced in the suspicions
of Guise, and vindication of Marmoutiere.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>The Duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth survived the catastrophe
of her husband many years; during which she was resolute
in asserting her right to be treated as a princess of the blood. She
had two surviving sons by Monmouth; one of whom carried on
the line of Buccleuch, and the other was created Earl of Deloraine.
She was married a second time, in 1688, to Lord Cornwallis,
by whom she had two surviving daughters. The Duchess
died in 1732, in the eighty-first year of her life. King James
made her Grace and her family a gift of all her original property,
so far as forfeited by the Duke of Monmouth's condemnation.</p>

<p>There is a libel among the State Poems, relating to some obscure
fray, in which the duke of Monmouth and some of his brothers
appear to have been concerned. This was probably one of
the youthful excesses alluded to.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> But Amnon's murder seems
to refer to the more noted assault upon sir John Coventry, which
the reader may take in the words of Andrew Marvell.</p>

<p>"But an accident happened, which had like to have spoiled all.
Sir John Coventry having moved (in the house of commons) for
an imposition on the play houses, sir John Berkenhead, to excuse
them, said they had been of great service to the king. Upon which,
sir John Coventry desired that gentleman to explain "whether
he meant the men or women players?"<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Hereupon it is imagined,
that the house adjourning from Tuesday, before, till Thursday
after Christmas day, on the very Tuesday night of the adjournment,
twenty-five of the duke of Monmouth's troop,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and some
few foot, laid in wait from ten at night, till two in the morning, and
as he returned from the Cock, where he supped, to his own
house, they threw him down, and with a knife cut off almost
all the end of his nose; but company coming, made them fearful
to finish it; so they marched off. Sir Thomas Sands, lieutenant
of the troop, commanded the party, and Obrian, the earl
of Inchequin's son, was a principal actor. The court hereupon
sometimes thought to carry it with a high hand, and
question sir John for his words, and maintain the action; sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>they flagged in their councils. However, the king commanded
sir Thomas Clarges, and sir W. Pulteney, to release Wroth,
and Lake, who were two of the actors, and taken. But the night
before the house met, they surrendered (to) him again. The house
being but sullen the next day, the court did not oppose adjourning
for some days longer, till it was filled. Then the house went upon
Coventry's business, and voted that they would go upon nothing
else whatever, till they had passed a bill, as they did, for Sands,
Obrian, Parry, and Reeves, to come in by the sixteenth of February,
or else be condemned, and never to be pardoned, but by an
express act of parliament, and their names therein inserted, for
fear of being pardoned in some general act of grace. Farther, all
such actions, for the future, on any man, felony without clergy;
and who shall otherwise strike or wound any parliament man, during
his attendance, or going or coming, imprisonment for a year,
treble damages, and incapacity. The bill having in some few days
been despatched to the lords, the house has since gone on in grand
committee upon the first 800,000l. bill, but are not yet half way.
But now the lords, instead of the sixteenth of February, put twenty-five
days after the king's royal assent, and that registered in their
journal; they disagree in several other things, but adhere in that
first which is material. So that, in this week, the houses will be in
danger of splitting, without much wisdom or force. For, considering
that sir Thomas Sands was the very person sent to Clarges and
Pulteney, that Obrian was concealed in the duke of Monmouth's
lodgings, that Wroth and Lake were bailed at sessions, by order
from Mr Attorney, and, that all persons and things are perfectly
discovered, that act will not be passed without great consequence."
Letter from Andrew Marvel, to William Romsden, in <i>Marvel's
Works</i>, Vol. I. p. 413.</p>

<p>This aggression led to what, from the name of the sufferer, is
called the Coventry act, making cutting, and maiming the person,
with intent to disfigure it, felony without benefit of clergy. A satirical
ballad on this subject, called the Haymarket Hectors, was
written by Andrew Marvel, which may be found in his works,
and, with some variations, in the third vol. of the State poems.
It has very little wit, to atone for a great deal of grossness.</p>

<p>The Papist plot, like every criminal and mysterious transaction,
where accomplices alone can give evidence, is involved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
much mystery. It is well known, that the zeal for making proselytes,
with all its good and all its evil consequences, is deeply
engrafted upon the catholic faith. There can be no doubt, from
Coleman's correspondence, that there was in agitation, among the
Catholics, a grand scheme to bring about the conversion of the
British kingdoms to the Romish religion. Much seemed to favour
this in the reign of Charles II. The king, though a latitudinarian,
was believed addicted to the religion of those countries
which had afforded him refuge in his adversity, and the
Duke of York was an open and zealous Papist. From the letters
of his secretary Coleman, it is obvious, that hopes were entertained
of eradicating the great northern heresy; and the real existence
of intrigues carried on with this purpose, unfortunately gave
a colour to the monstrous and absurd falsehoods which the witnesses
of the plot contrived to heap together. It is probable, that
Oates, by whom the affair was first started, knew nothing, but by
vague report and surmise, of the real designs of the Roman catholic
party; since he would otherwise have accommodated his story
better to their obvious interests. The catholics might gain much
by the life of Charles; but a plot to assassinate him, would have
been far from placing them an inch nearer their point, even supposing
them to escape the odium of so horrible a crime. The
Duke, it was true, was nearest in blood; but his succession to the
throne, had the king been taken off by those of his sect, would
have been a very difficult matter, since the very suspicion of such
a catastrophe had nearly caused his exclusion. But when the faction
involved the king also in the plot, which Oates positively
charges upon him in his last publication, and thereby renders him
an accessory before the fact to an attempt on his own life, the absurdity
is fully completed. Even according to the statement of
those who suppose that Charles had irritated the Roman catholics,
by preferring his ease and quiet to their interest and his own religious
feelings, his situation appears ludicrously distressing. For,
on the one hand, he incurred the hatred of those who called themselves
the Protestant party, for his obstinacy in exposing himself
to be murdered by the papists; and, on the other hand, he was
to be assassinated by the catholics, for not doing what, according
to this supposition, he himself most wished to do. It would be
far beyond our bounds, to notice the numberless gross absurdities
to which Oates and the other witnesses deposed upon oath. It
may appear almost incredible, in the present day, how such extravagant
fictions should be successfully palmed upon the deluded
public; but at that time there was not the same ready communication
by the press, which now allows opportunity to canvass an
extraordinary charge as soon as it is brought forward. The public
at large had no means of judging of state matters, but from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the bribed libellers of faction, and the haranguers in coffee-houses,
who gave what colour they pleased to the public news of the
day.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Besides, the catholics had given an handle against themselves,
by their own obscure intrigues; and it was impossible to forget
the desperate scheme of the Gunpowder Plot, by which they had
resolved to cut off the heresy in the time of King James. The
crime of the fathers was, in this case, visited on the children;
for no person probably would, or could, have believed in the catholic
plot of 1678, had not the same religious sect meditated
something equally desperate in 1606. It is true, the gunpowder
conspiracy was proved by the most unexceptionable testimony;
and the plot in Charles' time rested on the oaths of a few boldfaced
villains, who contradicted both themselves and each other;
but still popular credulity was prepared to believe any thing
charged on a sect, who had shown themselves so devoted to
their religious zeal, and so little scrupulous about means to
gratify it. Another main prop of the Catholic plot was the mystery
in which it was involved. If inconsistencies were pointed
out, or improbabilities urged, the answer was, that the discovery
had not yet reached the bottom of the plot. Thus the disposition
of the vulgar to believe the atrocious and the marvellous,
was heightened by the stimulus of ungratified curiosity, and
still impending danger. "Every new witness," says North, "that
came in, made us start&mdash;now we shall come to the bottom. And
so it continued from one witness to another, year after year, till at
length it had no bottom but in the bottomless pit."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Thus, betwixt
villainy and credulity, the spirits of the people were exasperated
and kept afloat, till the bloodhounds of the plot, like
those formerly used in pursuit of marauders, had drenched their
scent, and annihilated their powers of quest in the best blood in
the kingdom.</p>

<p>The unfortunate victims, whose lives were sworn away by Oates
and his accomplices, died averring their innocence; but the infuriated
people for some time gave little credit to this solemn exculpation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
believing that the religion of the criminals, or at least
the injunctions of their priests, imposed on them the obligation of
denying, with their last breath, whatever, if confessed, could have
prejudiced the catholic cause. As all high wrought frenzies are
incapable of duration, that of the Roman catholic plot decayed
greatly after the execution of the venerable Stafford. The decent
and manly sobriety of his demeanour on the scaffold, the recollection
of how much blood had been spilled, and how much more
might be poured out like water, excited the late and repentant
commiseration of the multitude: His protestations of innocence
were answered by broken exclamations of "God bless you, my
lord! we believe you." And after this last victim, the Popish
plot, like a serpent which had wasted its poison, though its
wreaths entangled many, and its terrors held their sway over
more, did little effectual mischief. Even when long lifeless, and
extinguished, this chimera, far in the succeeding reigns, continued,
like the dragon slain by the Red-cross Knight, to be the object of
popular fear, and the theme of credulous terrorists:</p>

<p>The author alludes to the wonderful project to assassinate the
king by Pickering and Groves, to which Oates bore testimony.
Pickering, a man in easy circumstances, and whom religious zeal
alone induced to murder his sovereign, was to have 30,000 masses;
and Groves, a more mercenary ruffian, was to be recompensed
with a sum, which, reckoning at a shilling a mass, should be an
equivalent in money. But this scheme misgave, because, according
to the evidence, the conscientious and opulent Mr Pickering
had furnished himself for the exploit with an old pistol, the cock
whereof was too loose to hold a flint. Another time they were
to come to Windsor, to execute their bloody purpose with
sword and dagger; but could find no better conveyance than miserable
hack horses, one of which became lame, and disconcerted
the expedition. Such at least was the apology made by Oates for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
their not appearing, when a party were, upon his information, stationed
to apprehend them.</p>

<p>Anthony, Earl of Shaftesbury, one of the principal heroes of

after was served with a bill of indictment for high treason; which
was thrown out by the grand jury, who returned a verdict of <i>Ignoramus</i>.

and in the notes is contained some account of his lordship's life,

<p>Anthony Ashley Cooper, second Earl of Shaftesbury, and son
of the great statesman, whom Dryden has dubbed his Achitophel.
The contemptuous language used towards him, is said not to have
reference to his outward appearance; for the portraits which remain
represent him at uncommonly handsome. Nay, so much
was his personal beauty an object of his attention, that he is said
to have hastened his decease by his solicitude to remove, by violent
means, an excrescence which disfigured his face. But the authority,
from which these circumstances are quoted, seems to admit,
that he was of a very insignificant character, at least not at all
distinguished by mental abilities. <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, Vol. IV.
p. 266. His want of capacity was a standing joke among the
Tories. In an ironical pamphlet, called "A modest Vindication
of the Earl of Shaftesbury, in a letter to a friend concerning his
being elected King of Poland," we have, among the list of his
officers of the crown, "Prince Prettyman Perkinoski (<i>i.e.</i> Monmouth),
our adopted heir, because a little wiser than our own son,
and designed to be offered to the diet as our successor."</p>

<p>It often happens, that men are more jealous of their own, or
their ancestors' reputation for talents, than for virtue. The third
Earl of Shaftesbury, author of the "Characteristics," is said to
have resented more deeply this occasional attack on his father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
understanding, than the satire against his grandfather, in which Dryden
has poured forth his whole energy. This passage is alleged
to have been the occasion of his mentioning Dryden disrespectfully
in several places of his works; a revenge more dishonourable to
his Lordship's taste than to the object of his spleen.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>The Earl of Shaftesbury is allowed to have been a principal adviser
of the Dutch war in 1672; by which the triple alliance between
England, Sweden, and Holland, the <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> of Sir
William Temple's negociation, by which France and Spain were
forced into the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, was for ever broken. It
was he who applied to Holland the famous saying, <i>Delenda est
Carthago</i>; and who, with all his wit and eloquence, furthered a
closer connection with France, to the destruction of our natural
ally. But when the success of the Dutch war was inferior to the
expectations of this ardent statesman, when he found himself
rivalled by Clifford and others in the favour of Charles, and when
he perceived that the king, to preserve his quiet, would not hesitate
to sacrifice an obnoxious minister, he chose to make what
some of his biographers have called <i>a short turn</i>; and, by going
over to the popular party, to escape the odium attached to the
measures he had himself recommended.</p>

<p>In 1672, the seals were given to the Earl of Shaftesbury, on the
resignation of the Lord Keeper, Sir Orlando Bridgeman; and he
was invested with the office of Lord High Chancellor. In the judicial
part of his duty, he appears to have merited the eulogium
so elegantly expressed in the text. One of his biographers uses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the following strong expressions: "With what prudence and candour,
honour, and integrity, he acquitted himself in that great and
weighty employment, the transactions of the Court of Chancery,
during the time of his chancellorship, will best testify. Justice,
then, ran in an equal channel; so that the cause of the rich was
not suffered to swallow up the rights of the poor, nor was the
strong or cunning oppressor permitted to devour the weak or unskilful
opposer: but the abused found relief suitable to their distress;
and those by whom they were abused, a severe reprehension,
answerable to their crimes. The mischievous consequences,
which commonly arise from the delays and other practices of that
court, were, by his ingenious and judicious management, very
much abated, and every thing weighed and determined with such
an exact judgment and equity, that it almost exceeds all possibility
of belief."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Yet even in this high situation, Shaftesbury could
not help displaying something of a temper more lively and freakish
than was consistent with the gravity of his place. His dress
was an odd mixture of the courtier and lawyer; being an ash-coloured
gown, silver-laced, with pantaloons garnished with ribbons;
nothing being black about him, save, peradventure, his hat, which
North, though he saw him, cannot positively affirm to have been
so.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Besides, he occasioned much dismay and discomfiture upon
the first day of the term, which succeeded his appointment,
by obliging the judges, law officers, &amp;c. who came, as usual, to
attend the great seal to Westminster-hall, to make this solemn procession
on horseback, according to ancient custom. As long as
the cavalcade was in the open street, this did well enough; but
when they came to strait passages and interruptions, "for want
of gravity in the beasts, and too much in the riders, there happened
some curvetting, which made no small disorder. Judge
Twisden, to his great affright, and the consternation of his
grave brethren, was laid all along in the dirt; but all at length
arrived safe, without loss of life or limb in the service."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> This
whimsical fancy of setting grave judges on managed horses, with
hazard both of damage and ridicule, to say nothing of bodily distress
and terror, is a curious trait of the mercurial Earl of Shaftesbury.</p>

him, that, while he was carrying him to dine with one Alderman
Willcox, he told him, "He was a man as true as steel, and a

<p>The legitimacy of the duke of Monmouth, though boldly and
repeatedly asserted by his immediate partizans, did not receive general
credit even in the popular faction. It was one of Shaftesbury's
principal advantages, to have chosen, for the ostensible head
of his party, a candidate, whose right, had he ever attained the
crown, must have fluctuated betwixt an elective and hereditary
title. The consciousness of how much he was to depend upon
Shaftesbury's arts, for stating and supporting so dubious a claim,
obliged the duke to remain at the devotion of that intriguing politician.
It seems to have been shrewdly suspected by some of
Monmouth's friends, that Shaftesbury had no real intention of serving
his interest. A poem, written by one of Monmouth's followers,
called "Judah Betrayed, or the Egyptian Plot turned on the
Israelites," expresses their fears, and very plainly intimates this
suspicion: and the reader may bear with some bad poetry, to be
convinced how far this faction was from being firmly united together:</p>

<p>In 1679, when the antipathy to popery had taken the deepest
root in men's minds, the House of Commons passed a vote, "That
the Duke of York's being a papist, and the hopes of his coming to
the crown, had given the highest countenance to the present conspiracies
and designs of the papists, against the king and the protestant
religion." Charles endeavoured to parry the obvious consequences
of this vote, by proposing to the council a set of limitations,
which deprived his successor, if a catholic, of the chief
branches of royalty. Shaftesbury, then president of the council,
argued against this plan as totally ineffectual; urging, that when
the future king should find a parliament to his mind, the limitations
might be as effectually taken off as they could be imposed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
When the bill was brought in, for the total exclusion of the Duke
of York from the succession, Shaftesbury favoured it with all his
influence. It passed the Lower House by a very large majority,
but was rejected by the House of Lords, where Halifax opposed it
with very great ability. Shaftesbury, who had taken so decided a
part against the Duke of York in his dearest interests, was now irreconcilable
with him, and could only look for safety in his ruin.</p>

<p>If we can believe the honourable Roger North, Lord Shaftesbury
made a fair experiment, for the purpose of ascertaining
whether Charles's love of ease and affection for Monmouth would
induce him to consent to an alteration of the succession in his favour,
to the prejudice of the Duke of York. He quotes a pamphlet,
called, "The Earl of Shaftesbury's expedient to settle the nation,
discoursed with his Majesty at Oxford, 24 March, 1681," which
gives the following account of the transaction; and, as it was published
at the time, and remained uncontradicted, either by Shaftesbury,
or the king, probably contains some essential truth. The
Earl of Shaftesbury having received, or pretended to receive, an
unsigned letter, in a disguised hand, bustled away to court, "as
hard," says the pamphleteer, "as legs, stick, and man could carry
him." When he arrived there, the Lord Chamberlain conceiving
the Duke of Monmouth might be in the secret, applied to him to
know what the great concern was. His grace answered, with an
appearance of hesitation, that it was something relating to himself,
in which, as in other affairs of his, Lord Shaftesbury took a deeper
concern than he desired. Meanwhile. Shaftesbury was introduced
to the audience he solicited with the king, and produced the letter,
containing, as he said, a plan for settling the interests of religion
and state, which proved to be a proposal for calling the Duke of
Monmouth to the succession. The king answered, he was surprized
such a plan should be pressed upon him, after all the declarations
he had made on the subject, and that, far from being
more timorous, he became more resolute the nearer he approached
his grave. Shaftesbury expressing great horror at such an expression,
the king assured him he was no less anxious for his own
preservation, than those who pretended to so much concern for the
security of his person; and yet, that he would rather lay down his
life than alter the true succession of the crown, against both law
and conscience. For that, said the earl, let us alone; we will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
a law for it. To which the king replied, that, if such was his lordship's
conscience, it was not his; and that he did not think even his
life of sufficient value to be preserved with the forfeiture of his
honour, and essential injury to the laws of the land.&mdash;<i>North's
Examen</i>, p. 100. 123.</p>

<p>Before James went to Flanders, he had testified a jealousy of
Monmouth. "The Duke of York, before he went abroad," says
Carte, "was concerned to see that the king could observe his frequent
whispers at court to the Lord Shaftesbury, without being
moved or expressing his dislike of it, but was much more alarmed
at hearing of their frequent and clandestine meetings, without any
apparent dissatisfaction expressed by his Majesty." p. 493. vol. II.</p>

<p>The royalists recriminated upon the popular party, the charge
of plots and machinations against the government. There is no
doubt that every engine was put in motion, to secure the mob of
London, "the Solymean rout" of Dryden, to Shaftesbury's party.
Every one has heard of the 30,000 brisk boys, who were ready to

<p>This inimitable description refers, as is well known, to the famous
George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, son of the favourite of
Charles I., who was murdered by Felton. The Restoration put
into the hands of the most lively, mercurial, ambitious, and licentious
genius, who ever lived, an estate of 20,000l a-year, to be
squandered in every wild scheme which the lust of power, of pleasure,
of licence, or of whim, could dictate to an unrestrained imagination.
Being refused the situation of President of the North,
he was suspected of having favoured the disaffected in that part
of England, and was disgraced accordingly. But, in 1666, he
regained the favour of the king, and became a member of the
famous administration called the Cabal, which first led Charles
into unpopular and arbitrary measures, and laid the foundation
for the troubles of his future reign. Buckingham changed
sides about 1675, and, becoming attached to the country party,
made a most active figure in all proceedings which had relation
to the Popish plot; intrigued deeply with Shaftesbury, and distinguished
himself as a promoter of the bill of exclusion. Hence,
he stood an eminent mark for Dryden's satire; which, we may believe,
was not the less poignant, that the poet had sustained a personal
affront, from being depicted by his grace under the character
of Bayes in the Rehearsal. As Dryden owed the Duke no favour,
he has shewn him none. Yet, even here, the ridiculous, rather
than the infamous part of his character, is touched upon; and the
unprincipled libertine, who slew the Earl of Shrewsbury while his
adulterous countess held his horse in the disguise of a page, and
who boasted of caressing her before he changed the bloody cloaths
in which he had murdered her husband,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> is not exposed to hatred,
while the spendthrift and castle-builder are held up to contempt.
So just, however, is the picture drawn by Dryden, that it differs
little from the following sober historical character.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Buckingham was a man of great parts, and an
infinite deal of wit and humour; but wanted judgement, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
no virtue, or principle of any kind. These essential defects made
his whole life one continued train of inconsistencies. He was ambitious
beyond measure, and implacable in his resentments; these
qualities were the effects, or different faces of his pride; which,
whenever he pleased to lay aside, no man living could be more entertaining
in conversation. He had a wonderful talent in turning
all things into ridicule; but, by his own conduct, made a more
ridiculous figure in the world, than any other he could, with all
his vivacity of wit, and turn of imagination, draw of others.
Frolick and pleasure took up the greatest part of his life; and in
these he neither had any taste, nor set himself any bounds; running
into the wildest extravagancies, and pushing his debaucheries
to a height, which even a libertine age could not help censuring as
downright madness. He inherited the best estate which any subject
had at that time in England; yet, his profuseness made him
always necessitous; as that necessity made him grasp at every
thing that would help to support his expences. He was lavish
without generosity, and proud without magnanimity; and, though
he did not want some bright talents, yet, no good one ever made
part of his composition; for there was nothing so mean that he
would not stoop to, nor any thing so flagrantly impious, but he
was capable of undertaking."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>A patron like Buckingham, who piqued himself on his knowledge
of literature, and had the means, if not the inclination, to be
liberal, was not likely to want champions, such as they were, to
repel the sharp attack of Dryden. Elkanah Settle compliments
him with the following lines in his "Absalom Senior," some of
which are really tolerable.</p>

<p>Another poet, at a period when interest could little sway his
panegyrick, has apologized for the versatility and extravagance of
the then deceased Duke of Buckingham:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">What though black envy, with her ran'crous tongue,</div>
  <div class="i0">And angry poets in embittered song,</div>
  <div class="i0">While to new tracks thy boundless soul aspires,</div>

  <div class="i0">Envy more base did never virtue wrong:</div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Buckingham himself, smarting under the severity of Dryden's
satire, strove to answer it in kind. He engaged in this work with
more zeal and anger, than wit or prudence. It is one thing to
write a farce, and another to support such a controversy with such
an author. The Duke's pamphlet, however, sold at a high price,
and had a celebrity, which is certainly rather to be imputed to the
rank and reputation of the author, than to the merit of the performance.
As it is the work of such an applauded wit, is exceedingly
scarce, and relates entirely to the poem which I am illustrating,
I shall here insert the introduction, and some extracts from the
piece itself.</p>

<p>It is entitled "Poetic Reflections on a late Poem, entituled,
Absalom and Achitophel, by a Person of Honour. London, printed
for Richard Janeway, 1682. (14 December.)"</p>

<p>To the Reader.&mdash;"To epitomize which scandalous pamphlet, unworthy
the denomination of poesy, no eye can inspect it without a
prodigious amazement, the abuses being so gross and deliberate,
that it seems rather a capital or national libel, than personal exposures,
in order to an infamous detraction. For how does he
character the King, but as a broad figure of scandalous inclinations,
or contrived into such irregularities, as renders him rather
the property of parasites and vice, than suitable to the accomplishment
of so excellent a prince. Nay, he forces on king David such
a royal resemblance, that he darkens his sanctity, in spite of illuminations
from holy writ.</p>

<p>"Next, to take as near our king as he could, he calumniates the
Duke of Monmouth, with that height of impudence, that his sense
is far blacker than his ink, exposing him to all the censures that a
murderer, a traitor, or what a subject of most ambitious evil
can possibly comprehend.</p>

<p>"As to my Lord Shaftesbury, in his collusive Achitophel, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
does he other than exceed malice itself, or that the more prudent
deserts of that Peer were to be so impeached before hand by his
impious poem, as that he might be granted more emphatically
condign of the hangman's axe, and which his muse does in effect
take upon her to hasten.</p>

<p>"And if the season be well observed when this adulterate poem
was spread, it will be found purposely divulged near the time when
this lord, with his other noble partner, were to be brought to their
trial; and, I suppose this poet thought himself enough assured of
their condemnation, at least that his genius had not otherwise
ventured to have trampled on persons of such eminent abilities
and interest in the nation; a consideration, I confess, incited my
pen, its preceding respect being paid to the duke of Monmouth, to
vindicate their reputations where I thought it due.</p>

<p>The noble author, with what cause the reader is now enabled to
determine, piqued himself especially upon the satirical vigour of
these last verses. "As to the character of Amiel, I confess my
lines are something pointed: the one reason being, that it alludes
much to a manner of expression of this writer's, as may be seen by
the marginal notes; and a second will soon be allowed. The figure
of Amiel has been so squeezed into paint, that his soul is seen in
spite of the varnish." As these verses were written on an occasion,
when personal indignation must have fired his Grace's wit,
they incline us to believe, with Mr Malone, that his friends, Clifford
and Sprat, had the greatest share in the lively farce of "The
Rehearsal."</p>

<p>Buckingham's death was as awful a beacon as his life. He had
dissipated a princely fortune, and lost both the means of procuring,
and the power of enjoying, the pleasures to which he was
devoted. He had fallen from the highest pinnacle of ambition,
into the last degree of contempt and disregard. His dying scene,
in a paltry inn in Yorkshire, has been immortalized by Pope's
beautiful lines:</p>

<p>The Earl of Huntington. A coarse reason is given by Luttrel
in his MS. notes, for the epithet by which he is distinguished in
the text.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> He was one of the seventeen peers who signed a petition,
beseeching Charles to have recourse to the advice of his parliament;
and he himself presented it at Whitehall, on the 7th of
December, 1679, in the name of the other lords subscribing. This
advice was received very coldly by the king, who answered, "That
he would consider of what they had offered, and could heartily
wish, that all other people were as solicitous for the peace and
good of the nation, as he would ever be." The Earl of Huntington
also subscribed the petition and advice, presented by fifteen
peers to the king, against removing the parliament to Oxford;
where they stated, "Neither Lords nor Commons can be in safety,
but will be daily exposed to the swords of the Papists, and their
adherents, of whom too many are crept into your majesty's
guards." Yet Lord Huntington did not go all the lengths of
the Whig party. He became a privy councillor, was admitted to the
honour of kissing the king's hand, and was stated in the Public
Intelligencer, of the 25th of October, 1681, to have then confessed,
that he had found by experience, "That they who promoted
the bill of exclusion, were for the subversion of monarchy itself."
Monmouth, Grey, and Herbert, state, in a paper published on this
occasion, that Lord Huntington had denied the utterance of the
said words; but, from the stile of their manifesto, it is obvious,
they no longer regarded him as attached to their party. <i>Ralph's

<p>He appears to have been a man of very great indifference
to his domestic concerns; as the Duke of Monmouth, under
whose banners he enlisted himself, was generally believed to have
an intrigue with Lady Grey. In an account of a mock apparition,
which that lady is supposed to witness, she is made to state,
"That on Saturday, the 29th of January, 1680, being alone in
her closet about nine o'clock at night, she heard a voice behind
her, which mildly said, <em>sweetheart</em>. At which she was at first not
at all frightened, supposing it to be an apparition, which she says
has often of late appeared to her <em>in the absence of her lord</em>, in the
shape of a <em>bright star and blue garter</em>, but without hurting, or so
much as frightening her." Lord Grey, ignorant or indifferent
about these scandalous reports, went step for step with Monmouth
in all his projects. He was a man of a restless temper, and
lively talents, which he exercised in the service of the popular
party. He was deep in the Rye-house Plot, and probably engaged
in the very worst part of it; at least, Lord Howard deposed,
that Grey was full of expectation of some great thing to
be attempted on the day of the king's coming from Newmarket,
which was that fixed by the inferior conspirators for his assassination.
Upon the trial of Lord Russel, Howard was yet more
particular, and said, that upon a dark intimation of an attempt on
the king's person, the Duke of Monmouth, "with great emotion,
struck his breast, and cried out, 'God so! kill the king! I will never
suffer them.' That Lord Grey, with an oath, also observed
upon it, that if they made such an attempt, they could not fail."
Ramsey charged Lord Grey with arguing with Ferguson, on the
project of the rising at Taunton. Grey, on the first discovery of
this conspiracy, was arrested, but, filling the officers drunk, he escaped
in a boat, and fled into Holland. He was afterwards very
active in pushing on Monmouth to his desperate expedition in
1685. He landed with the duke at Lyme, and held the rank of
general of horse in his army. Like many other politicians, his
lordship proved totally devoid of that courage in executing bold
plans, which he displayed in forming or abetting them. At
the first skirmish at Bridport he ran away, although the troops he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
commanded did not follow his example, but actually gained a victory,
while he returned on the gallop to announce a total defeat.
Monmouth, much shocked, asked Colonel Mathews what he should
do with him? who answered, he believed there was not another general
in Europe would have asked such a question. Lord Grey, however,
fatally for Monmouth, continued in his trust, and commanded
the horse at the battle of Sedgemore. There he behaved like a
poltroon as formerly, fled with the whole cavalry, and left the foot,
who behaved most gallantly, to be cut to pieces by the horse of
King James, who, without amusing themselves with pursuit, wheeled,
and fell upon the rear of the hardy western peasants. So infamous
was Grey's conduct, that many writers at the time, thinking
mere cowardice insufficient to account for it, have surmised,
some, that he was employed by the king to decoy Monmouth to
his destruction; and others, that jealousy of the domestic injury
he had received from the duke, induced him to betray the army.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
This caitiff peer was taken in the disguise of a shepherd, near
Holt Lodge, in Dorsetshire; and confessed, that "since his landing
in England, he had never enjoyed a quiet meal, or a night's repose."
He was conveyed to London, and would probably have
been executed, had it not been discovered, that his estate, which
had been given to Lord Rochester, was so strictly entailed, that nothing
could be got by his death. He, therefore, by the liberal
distribution, it is said, of large sums of money, received a pardon
from the king, and appeared as a witness on the trial of Lord
Delamere; and was ready to do so on that of Hampden; yet he is supposed
to have kept some secrets with respect to the politics of the
Prince of Orange, in reward of which, he was raised to the rank
of an Earl after the Revolution.&mdash;<cite>Dalrymple's Memoirs</cite>, Vol. I. p.
185.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the attribute which Dryden has ascribed to
Lord Grey in this poem, he afterwards proved a man of unprincipled
gallantry; and 23d of November, 1682, was tried in the
King's Bench for debauching lady Henrietta Berkeley, daughter of
the Earl of Berkeley, to whose sister, lady Mary, he was himself
married. See <i>State Trials</i>, Vol. III. p. 519.</p>

</div>

<p>Lord Howard of Escricke, although an abandoned debauchee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
made occasional pretensions to piety. He was an intimate of
Shaftesbury and of Monmouth, but detested by Russel on account
of the infamy of his character. Plots, counter-plots, and
sham-plots, were at this time wrought like mine and countermine
by each party, under the other's vantage-ground. One Fitzharris
had written a virulent libel against the court party, which
he probably intended to father upon the whigs; but being seized
by Sir William Waller, he changed his note, and averred, that he
had been employed by the court to write this libel, and to fix it
upon the exclusionists; and to this probable story he added, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex
mera gratia</i>, a new account of the old Popish Plot. The court resolved
to make an example of Fitzharris; they tried and convicted
him of treason, for the libel fell nothing short of it. When condemned,
finding his sole resource in the mercy of the crown, he
retracted his evidence against the court, and affirmed, that Treby,
the recorder, and Bethel and Cornish, the two sheriffs, had induced
him to forge that accusation; and that Lord Howard was the
person who drew up instructions, pointing out to him what he was
to swear, and urging him so to manage his evidence, as to criminate
the Queen and the Duke of York. The confession of Fitzharris
did not save his life, although he adhered to it upon the
scaffold. Lord Howard, as involved in this criminal intrigue, was
sent to the Tower, where he uttered and published a canting declaration,
asserting his innocence, upon the truth of which he received
the sacrament. He is said, however, to have taken the communion
in <i>lamb's wool</i>, (<i>i. e.</i> ale poured on roasted apples and
sugar,) to which profanation Dryden alludes, with too much levity,
in the second line above quoted. The circumstance is also
mentioned in "Absalom's IX Worthies:"</p>

  <div class="i0">To erect his Paschal-lamb's-wool-sacrament.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lord Howard was at length set at liberty from the Tower, upon
finding bail, when he engaged under Shaftesbury, and ran into
all the excesses of the party. Being deeply involved in the Rye-house
Plot, he fled upon the discovery of that affair, and was detected
in his shirt, covered with soot, in a chimney; a sordid
place of concealment, which well suited the spirit of the man.
A tory ballad-maker has the following strain of prophetic exultation
on Howard's commitment:</p>

<p>Accustomed to tamper with evidence, Howard did not hesitate
to contaminate the noblest name in England, by practising
the meannesses and villainies he had taught to others. For the
sake of his shameful life, he bore witness against Russel and
Sidney to all he knew, and probably to a great deal more. The
former had always hated and despised Howard, and had only
been induced to tolerate his company by the persuasions of Essex:
The recollection, that, by introducing his best friend to the contagion
of such company, he had, in fact, prepared his ruin, was
one of the reasons assigned for that unfortunate peer's remorse and
suicide.</p>

<p>Sir William Jones was an excellent lawyer, and, in his private
character, an upright, worthy, and virtuous man; in his religion
he had some tendency to nonconformity, and his political principles
were of the popular cast. He was the king's attorney-general,
and as such conducted all the prosecutions against those concerned
in the Popish plot. He was, or affected to be, so deeply infected by
the epidemic terror excited by this supposed conspiracy, that he had
all his billets removed from his cellar, lest the Papists should throw
in fire-balls, and set his house on fire. He closed, nevertheless, with
the court, in an attempt to prohibit coffee-houses, on account of the
facility which they afforded in propagating faction and scandal; for
this, he was threatened by the country party with an impeachment
in parliament. Sir William Jones shortly after resigned his office
under government, and went into open opposition. He distinguished
himself particularly, by supporting the bill of exclusion, and by
a violent speech in the Oxford parliament, on the subject of the
clerk's mislaying the Bill for repealing the 35th of Elizabeth, an
act against dissenters. He was on his legs, as the phrase is, in the
same house, arguing vehemently on the subject of Fitzharris, when
the Black Rod knocked at the door, to announce the sudden and
unexpected dissolution of the parliament. A well written pamphlet,
entitled, "Advice to Grand Juries," which appeared on the
eve of the presentment against Shaftesbury, is said to have had
some effect in producing the ignoramus verdict, on that bill.</p>

<p>Sir William Jones is said to have regretted the share he took
in the prosecutions on account of the plot; which is extremely
probable, as his excellent talents, and sound legal principles, could
not fail, when clamour and alarm were over, to teach him how far
he had been misled. His anxiety for the situation of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
is supposed to have accelerated his death, which took place in
1682, at Mr Hampden's house, in Buckingham-shire.</p>

<p>Slingsby Bethel was son of Sir Walter Bethel, knight, by Mary,
daughter of Sir Henry Slingsby of Scriven, in Yorkshire, and sister
to Sir Henry Slingsby, a steady loyalist, who was condemned by
Cromwell's high court of justice, and beheaded on Towerhill in
1655. Bethel was early attached to the fanatical interest, both
by religious and political tenets; he was even a member of the
Committee of Safety. But he was a staunch republican, and no
friend to the Protector; being, it is believed, the author of that
famous treatise, entitled "The World's Mistake in Oliver Cromwell."
He was elected sheriff, with Cornish, on Midsummer-day
1680, and the choice was, in many respects, disadvantageous
to the popular party. In the first place, they were both
Independents; and, before taking upon them their offices, they
conformed, and took the sacrament according to the church
of England's ritual. It was believed, that nothing but the necessity
of qualifying themselves to serve their party in this office,
could have prevailed on them to have done so, and this gave advantages
against their whole party. Besides, Cornish was a downright,
plain-spoken republican, and Bethel had expressed himself very
bluntly in justification of the execution of Charles I.; and was,
therefore, obnoxious to every slur which the royalists could bring
against him, as ill-disposed to monarchy. Further still, Bethel's
extreme and sordid meanness gave great disgust to the citizens,
who were accustomed to consider the exercise of a splendid
and ostentatious hospitality as the principal part of a sheriff's duty.
He kept no table, lived in a chop-house, and, long afterwards,
whoever neglected to entertain during his shrievalty, was said to
"<i>Bethel</i> the city." Bethel is mentioned among the subjects of deprecation
in "The Loyal Litany:"</p>

<p>These two sheriffs first set the example of packing juries, when
persons were to be tried for party offences; for they took the task
of settling the pannels for juries out of the Compters into their
own hands, and left the secondaries of the Compters, who had
usually discharged that duty, only to return the lists, thus previously
made up. In Middlesex, they had the assistance of Goodenough,
the under-sheriff, a bustling and active partizan, who very
narrowly escaped being hanged for the Rye-house Plot. By this
selection of jurymen, the sheriffs insured a certainty of casting
such bills as might be presented to the Grand Jury against any
of their partizans. This practice was so openly avowed, that Settle
has ventured to make it a subject of eulogy:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Next Hethriel write Baal's watchful foe, and late</div>
  <div class="i0">Jerusalem's protecting magistrate;</div>

  <div class="i0">Saw depraved justice ope her ravenous maw,</div>
  <div class="i0">And timely broke her canine teeth of law.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Earl of Shaftesbury himself reaped the advantage of this man&oelig;uvre;
which, from the technical word employed in the return
of these bills, was called <i>Ignoramus</i>. Stephen Colledge, the Protestant
joiner, also experienced the benefit of a packed jury, though
concerned in all the seditious practices of the time. He was afterwards
tried, condemned, and executed at Oxford, where he was
out of the magic circle of the sheriff's protection; and, though I
believe the man deserved to die, he certainly at last met with hard
measure. His death was supposed to have broke the talisman of
Ignoramus, and was considered as a triumph by the Tories, who,
for a long time, had been unable to persuade a jury to find for the
king.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> When Lord Stafford was most unjustly condemned, Bethel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and his brother sheriff affected a barbarous scruple, whether
the king was entitled to commute the statutory punishment of high
treason into simple decapitation. The House of Commons ordered
that the king's writ be obeyed. This hard-hearted conduct
was an indulgence of their republican humour. Shortly after, Mr
Bethel was found guilty of a riot and assault upon one of the king's
watermen at the election of members of parliament for Southwark,
5th October, 1681. This person being active in the poll, Mr Bethel
caned him, and told him he would have his coat (the king's
livery) stripped over his ears. For this he was fined five merks.
Bethel, notwithstanding his violence, was so fortunate as to escape
the business of the Rye-house Plot. His brother sheriff, Cornish,
was not so fortunate: He was a plain republican, and highly esteemed
by Lord Russell, for having treated with indifference the
apprehension of the Tower firing on the city, saying, they could
only demolish a few chimneys. He was executed as an accomplice
in the Rye-house conspiracy, upon the evidence of that very
Goodenough, who had been his tool in packing the illegal juries;
so that his death seemed a retribution for dishonouring and perverting
the course of justice. James II. was afterwards satisfied that
Cornish had been unjustly executed, and restored his estate to his
family.</p>

<p>Titus Oates, once called and believed the Saviour of his country,
was one of the most infamous villains whom history is obliged
to record. He was the son of an anabaptist ribbon-weaver, received a
tolerably good education, and, having taken orders, was preferred to
a small vicarage in Kent. Here the future protestant witness was
guilty of various irregularities, for which he was at length silenced
by the bishop, and by the Duke of Norfolk deprived of his qualification
as chaplain. At this pinching emergency he became a papist,
either for bread, or, as he afterwards boasted, for the purpose of insinuating
himself into the secrets of the Jesuits, and betraying them.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jesuits setting little store by their proselyte, whose talents lay
only in cunning and impudence, he skulked about St Omers and
other foreign seminaries in a miserable condition. Undoubtedly
he had then the opportunity of acquiring that list of names of the
order of Jesus with which he graced his plot, and might perhaps hear
something generally of the plans, which these intriguing churchmen
hoped to carry through in England by means of the Duke of York.
Of these, however, he must have had a very imperfect suspicion;
for the scheme which is displayed in the letters of Coleman, the
duke's secretary, does not at all quadrate with the doctor's pretended
discovery. When confronted with Coleman, he did not
even know him personally. When the king asked him about the
personal appearance of Don John of Austria, he described him, at
a venture, as a tall thin black man, being the usual Spanish figure
and complexion; but, unfortunately, he was little, fair, and fat.
In a word, it was impossible such a villain could have obtained a
moment's credit, but for the discovery of Coleman's actual intrigues,
the furious temper of the times, and the mysterious death of
Sir Edmondbury Godfrey. On that last occasion he displayed
much dexterity. There was some difficulty in managing the evidence,
whether to bring the assassination to the conspiracy, or the
conspiracy to the assassination; but Oates contrived the matter
with such ingenuity, that the murder became a proof, and the
plot became a proof of the murder, to the universal conviction of
the public. As to Oates' other qualities, he was, like every renegade,
a licentious scoffer at religion, and, in his manners, addicted,
it is said, to the most foul and unnatural debaucheries. When we
consider his acts and monuments, it is almost impossible to believe,
how so base a tool should have ever obtained credit and
opportunity to do such mighty mischief.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>As for his family, to which Dryden alludes a little below, "he
would needs," says North, "be descended of some ancient and worshipful
stock; but there were not so many noble families strove
for him, as there were cities strove for the <i>parentele</i> of Homer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
However, the heralds were sent for, to make out his pedigree, and
give him a blazon. They were posed at the first of these, but they
made good the blazon for him in a trice, and delivered it <i>authenticamente</i>,
and it was engraved on his table and other plate; for
he was rich, set up for a solemn housekeeper, and lived up to his
quality."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Dryden compares Oates to the brazen serpent raised up in the
wilderness, by looking on which, the Israelites were cured of the
bites of the fiery snakes. Sprat had applied the same simile, in

<p>North has left us some specimens of Oates' peculiar mode of pronounciation.
Bedloe, his brother-witness in the plot, had been taken
ill at Bristol, and, on his death-bed, held some conference with
the Lord Chief-Justice North, then upon a circuit, who took
down his examination, concerning which numerous reports went
forth. It proved, however, to be the same story he had formerly
told. Even Dr Oates himself was disappointed; and was heard
to say aloud, as the Lord Chief-Justice passed through the court
on a council-day, at all which times he was a diligent attendant,
"Maay Laird Chaife-Jaistaice, whay this baisness of Baidlaw caims
to naithaing." But his Lordship walked on without attending to
his discourse.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>In personal appearance North informs us, that "he was a low
man, of an ill-cut very short neck; and his visage and features
were most particular. His mouth was the centre of his face, and
a compass there would sweep his nose, forehead, and chin, within
the perimeter. <i>Cave quos Deus ipse notavit.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> An engraving of
the doctor, now before me, bears witness to this last peculiarity,
and does justice to the cherubic plenitude of countenance and chin
mentioned in the text. It is drawn and engraved by Richard
White, and bears to be "the true originall, taken from the life,
done for Henry Brome and Richard Chiswel; all others are counterfeit."</p>

<p>As the doctor's portrait is not now quite so common as
when the lady, mentioned in the Spectator, wore it upon her fan,
gloves, and handkerchief, the curious reader may be pleased to be
informed, that this "true original" is prefixed to "The Witch of
Endor, or the Witchcrafts of the Roman Jezebel, by Titus Oates,
D. D. folio 1679." It is dedicated to the Earl of Shaftesbury,

<p>Oates pretended to have taken his doctor's degree at Salamanca,
where it is shrewdly suspected he never was; at least where he
certainly never took orders. The Tory libels of the time contain
innumerable girds concerning this degree. There is, in the

  <div class="i0"><i>And Corah might for Agag's murder call,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i>In terms as coarse as Samuel used to Saul.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_237">237.</a></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the first book of Samuel, chap. xv., the reader will find the reproaches
with which that prophet loaded Saul, for sparing, contrary
to God's commandment, Agag, king of the Amalekites; concluding
with the awful denunciation, that for his disobedience the Lord
had rejected him from being king over Israel.</p>

<p>Agag's murder is to be understood of the mysterious death of
Sir Edmondbury Godfrey. This gentleman was an active justice
of peace, and had been knighted by Charles II., on account of his
exertions during the fire of London. In other respects, he was
low-spirited, and rather a timorous man, and, in the exercise of
his office, favourable to the Catholics. Oates, finding the information
he had lodged with the ministers concerning the Popish plot
rather less ardently listened to than he expected, chose to utter
before this magistrate a full declaration on the subject upon oath.
His intention was probably to make the matter as public as possible.
Godfrey expressed much unwillingness to have any thing to
do with the matter at all; and when he had heard the story out, expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
to his friends his fear that he should have no thanks for his
pains, but would probably be the first martyr. This strange, and
one would think absurd, boding proved too true; after having been
missing for several days, this unfortunate man was found lying
in a ditch, near Primrose-hill. There were marks of strangling
round his neck; and although his own sword was thrust through his
body, yet it turned out to have been done after death. His money
and rings were safe; robbery was therefore out of the question.
This murder ever will remain among the riddles of history. Three
opinions have been entertained: 1st, North does not hesitate to
affirm, that the contrivers and abettors of the plot murdered this
poor man, to give some colour to the story of the bloody machinations
of the Papists: But this seems too strange and desperate
a course to be imputed to the opposition party at large without
some positive proof; and as for Oates and his brother witnesses,
(whom we will not injure by suspecting them capable of remorseful,
or compunctious visitings,) their steps were, at this time, too
much the object of observation to admit of their executing so
bloody a plan with the necessary degree of secrecy. 2d, It has been
thought that Godfrey, a man of a melancholy temperament, whose
dark and cloudy spirit had been just agitated by a strange tale of
blood and mystery, may have been wrought up to take that time to
commit suicide. It is even positively asserted, that he hanged himself
at home, and that his brothers conveyed the body to the place
where it was found, to avoid the shame and other consequences of his
fate becoming public. There is something plausible in this account;
but it is entirely unsupported by proof of any kind. 3d, The grand
solution, and indeed the only one which would go down at the time,
was, that Godfrey had fallen by the papists. There were probably
enough of fanatics in that sect to have executed such a deed, had it
been of consequence to the progress of their religion: But there
appears no adequate motive for taking off Godfrey, who had merely
taken down a deposition which he could not refuse to receive, and
who had besides endeavoured to serve the accused parties, by transmitting
to Coleman an account of the affidavit; while Oates and
his companions, the depositaries of the supposed secret, and whose
death would stifle the plot for ever, were suffered to walk about,
even unattempted. Positive evidence was however obtained, to silence
all hypothetical reasoning on the subject. One Bedlow, a
very infamous character, amid a thousand dreadful stories of fires
raised by the Jesuits from 1666 downwards, charged the Catholics,
and particularly Miles Prance, a silver-smith, with the death of
Godfrey<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>. This man was imprisoned in Newgate; and, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
much communing with Shaftesbury and Buckingham, in which,
it is said, neither threats, promises, nor actual tortures were spared,
confessed himself an accomplice in the murder.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> He retracted
this confession before the privy-council; but being remanded to
prison, new terrors, promises, and sufferings, induced him to retract
that retractation. His story was a tissue of improbabilities; and
he and Bedlow, when adduced as evidence on the trial of three
poor men, whom they charged with strangling Godfrey, concealing
the body in Somerset-House, and afterwards disposing of it
on Primrose-hill, contradicted each other, and contradicted themselves.
All was in vain: the three innocent victims of perjury
were condemned and executed, and the witnesses promoted and
rewarded, not with money only, but, strange to say, with universal
respect and regard; although their merit, supposing it to be real,
was that of murderers and incendiaries, who had turned evidence
for the crown against their accomplices.</p>

<p>The outcry raised about Godfrey's murder at the time, and for
long after, gave the plot its surest foundation and support. When
his funeral rites were performed, the crowd was prodigious, and
the papists were sufficiently cautious to keep within doors, or
some might have been offered up as an oblation to the manes of
Justice Godfrey. While the clergyman preached the funeral sermon
of the protestant victim, two robust divines stood by him in
the pulpit, lest, while rendering this last duty to the murdered magistrate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
he should <i>in facie ecclesiæ</i> be murdered by the papists.
At the formal pope-burnings of the party, Sir Edmondbury, supported
on a steed by his murderers, was a principal figure in the
procession, preceded by a harbinger, who rung a bell, and admonished
the people to remember Justice Godfrey. In short, this unfortunate
gentleman's death, however it came about, continued
long to be the watch-word and war-cry of those, who called themselves
the true protestant party.</p>

<p>"In August, 1680, the Duke of Monmouth went into the country
to divert himself, visiting several gentlemen in the west of England,
by whom he was received and entertained with a gallantry suitable
to the greatness of his birth, and the relation he stood in to his majesty;
incredible numbers of people flocking from all the adjacent
parts to see this great champion of the English nation, who had
been so successful against both the Dutch, French, and Scots.
He went first into Wiltshire, and was pleased to honour the worthy
esquire Thynne with his company for some days. From thence he
went to Mr Speak's, in Somersetshire, in which progress he was caressed
with the joyful acclamations of the country people, who
came from all parts; twenty miles about the lanes and hedges being
every where lined with men, women, and children, who, with
incessant shouts, cried, "God bless King Charles and the Protestant
Duke!" In some towns and parishes which he passed
through, they strewed the streets and highways where he was to
pass with herbs and flowers, especially at Ilchester and Pithyton;
others presenting him with bottles of wine. When he came within
ten miles of Mr Speak's, he was met by two thousand persons on
horseback, whose numbers still increased as they drew nearer to
Mr Speak's, and when they arrived there, they were reputed to
be twenty thousand; wherefore they were forced to break down
several pearch of his park pales to enlarge their passage to the
house, where his grace and all this numerous company were entertained
and treated, in an extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>"On the 26th, he went to Brompton; being met on the road by
a great company of gentry and country people, who conducted
him to Sir J. Sydenham's, where he was entertained at a noble and
splendid dinner. The next day he went to Barrington, where he
was pleased to honour Mr William Stroud with his company at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
dinner; the entertainment being nothing inferior to what his Grace
had met with in all other places. After dinner he went to
Chard, where he arrived about five in the afternoon, attended
with a train of five thousand horsemen; and there he was met and
welcomed by a crowd of men, women, and children, who had not
a mute among them, but were almost all of them made deaf by
their own shouts and acclamations of joy. His Grace lay there
that night, being treated at a very splendid supper; he lodged at the
house of M. Prideaux.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The next day, having been entertained at
a sumptuous dinner, he rid to Ilminster, and in the afternoon he
went to Whitelackindon, where he lay that night; and the day
following, which was Sunday, his grace observed the Sabbath with
a religious care, and went to Ilminster church. On the 30th, he
went to Calliton, where he was entertained by Sir Walter Young.
The next day he went to Overton, where he was entertained, and
lodged by Mr Dukes. From thence he went to Exeter, and was
met by the citizens and the people of all the adjacent parts, to the
number of twenty thousand persons; but that which was more remarkable,
was the appearance of a brave company of brisk, stout young
men, all clothed in linen waistcoats and drawers, white, and harmless,
having not so much as a stick in their hands; they were in number
about nine hundred or a thousand; they went three miles out of
the city to meet his Grace, where they were drawn up all on a little
hill, and divided into two parts, in which order they attended
the Duke's coming, who rid up first between them, and then round
each company; after which they united, and went hand in hand
in order before, where he was no sooner arrived, but a universal
shout from all parts echoed forth his welcome; the numerous
concourse of people, the incredible and amazing acclamations, and
the universal joy which then filled the whole city, far exceeding
my pen to describe.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>"From thence he returned to Mr Speake's, where the whole
country flocked again to see and admire him, not being enough satisfied
with their former sight. From thence he went the next
day to Mr Harvie's, near Yeovil, where he dined, and in the afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>he rid to Esquire Thynne's; people flocking from all the
towns and villages thereabout to Howden-hill, where they attended
the Duke's coming; and after they had, by loud acclamations,
proclaimed his welcome amongst them, and expressed their joy
for his safe return, they took their leave of him, returning his
Grace their humble and hearty thanks for that kind visit, and for
his having condescended to accept of their plain, but true-hearted
entertainment. From thence he returned to London, wonderfully
pleased with the noble and generous entertainment he met with
at the several places where he came; every place striving to out-vye
each other."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>At Tunbridge Wells. "Abundance of country people rudely
crowded, after their rustic manner, to see the eldest son of their
king and sovereign, every one extolling him to the skies, crying to
one another, 'O what a brave man he is!' Some admired the
beauty and make of his person; some the majesty and port of his
carriage; and others, who had seen the king, the exact resemblance
he bare to his majesty; affirming, they never, in all their
lives, saw a son resemble a father more than the duke did the
king; but all admired his affable and courteous disposition."<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>These assemblies were chiefly made under pretence of cock-matches,
horse-races, and other popular amusements; pretexts the
more dangerous, as they were the well-known signals of rendezvous
at which the cavaliers were wont to concert their plots
against Cromwell. See the tract called "Killing no Murder."
Foot races, wrestling matches, and other country pastimes, were
also resorted to as an ostensible cause of meeting. These gave
Monmouth an opportunity to display his personal agility and liberality.
He wrestled, he ran, and carried off the prize, in both
exercises; he then ran in his boots against the peasants in their
shoes, and still obtained the victory. The prizes which he gained
were freely distributed among his competitors. All these arts of
popularity became the derision of his enemies, when he was forced
into exile; as, for example, in the following verses:</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These ostentatious progresses were devised by Shaftesbury, as a
mode of manifesting the strength of Monmouth's party, and increasing
his partizans and popularity. Among the higher ranks,
they carried an air of defiance which rather hurt his cause; for
reflecting and cautious men were slow to join in what seemed to
be a preliminary for civil war. It was different with the lower orders,
who, always biassed by what is more immediately addressed
to their eye-sight, were led by these showy processions, and by the
courtesy, activity, and fine presence of Monmouth, to doat on him
to an incredible degree. Not only did the western peasantry, on his
landing in 1685, crowd to join him in multitudes beyond what he
could arm, but their attachment survived even his defeat and
death; and they long believed, with fond credulity, that another
person had been executed in his stead, and that their beloved
protestant prince was still alive.</p>

<p>The arts of Absalom, in stealing the hearts of Israel from his
father, form an exact parallel to the language which Dryden puts
in the mouth of Monmouth.</p>

<p>"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. And Absalom
rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it
was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the
king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of
what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is one of the tribes
of Israel. And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good
and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
that every man, which hath any suit or cause, might come unto
me, and I would do him justice! And it was so, that when any
man came nigh unto him to do him obeisance, he put forth
his hand, and took him, and kissed him. And on this manner did
Absalom to all Israel, that came to the king for judgment. So
Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel." 2d Sam. chap.
xv. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

<p>Thomas Thynne, esquire, of Longleat-hall, called, from his great
wealth, <cite>Tom of Ten Thousand</cite>. He had been formerly a friend of
the Duke of York, but, upon some quarrel between them, he attached
himself warmly to Monmouth. Mr Thynne was one of those gentlemen,
who petitioned for the speedy meeting of parliament, after it
was prorogued in 1679, on account of the heat with which the house
pursued the Exclusion Bill. The king received the intimation very
ill; told Mr Thynne, he was surprised at persons of property countenancing
such proceedings, and that he wished they would mind
their own affairs, and leave him to attend to his. When Monmouth
made his progress through the west of England, as mentioned
in the last note, Mr Thynne received him at his country-seat
with all the splendour and liberality of ancient English hospitality.
This gentleman's tragical fate is well known. He was
married to the Lady Ogle, sole heiress of the Northumberland
estate; but, his bride going abroad, the marriage was never consummated.
Count Konigsmark met the lady, fell in love with
her person, or with her fortune, and could see no better road
to both than by assassinating her husband. Accordingly, three
foreigners, hired by the count, or dependents upon him, waylaid
Mr Thynne's carriage, as it passed through Pall-Mall, and shot
him with a blunderbuss, in the manner represented on his tombstone
in Westminster Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The Duke of Monmouth had
left the carriage about an hour before the murder; and sir John
Reresby received the thanks of the king for his activity in
apprehending the assassins, without which, suspicions might have
arisen that the attempt was intended against Monmouth by the
court party.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Monmouth himself remained all night with his dying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>friend, and distinguished himself by his zeal and assiduity in furthering
the search after the murderers. At length, Count Konigsmark
was taken by Gibbons, one of Monmouth's attendants, who
seized him, as he was going on ship-board. When apprehended, Gibbons
charged him with the fact, and added, that he had like to have
killed his master, the Duke of Monmouth; to which the Count answered,
"they would not have killed <em>him</em>." The three actual assassins
were condemned to death; but, by some foul play,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Konigsmark,
who had employed them, and who came over to England expressly
to see that they executed their bloody commission, was acquitted.
Monmouth went to see these subaltern villains executed.

<p>The accusations against York and the Queen were no part of
Oate's original plot. On the contrary, in the summary of his
"True Narrative," he informs us, that the "Royal family of the
Stuarts are condemned to be cut off, root and branch, and namely,
the King, Duke of York, and Prince of Orange, because that
family have not answered their expectation, nor have they any hopes
that any of them will comply fully with this their bloody design,
when fully discovered to them." And on the next page, it is again affirmed,
that notwithstanding the Duke of York's zeal for the Catholic
religion, "they design to dispose of him as is aforesaid." But
when the public belief in the plot had taken root, and Shaftesbury
had grafted upon it his doctrine of exclusion, Oates, by degrees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
charged the Duke, first with being the innocent and blind tool of the
Catholics whom they intended to succeed his brother, though he
knew nothing of their designs; and finally, with being at the very
depth of all the villainy, and the immediate author of the Fire of
London. As for the queen, her barrenness was a reason, for
all the exclusionists desiring she should be removed, that the
king might have a chance of legitimate issue, to the exclusion
of the Duke of York. Animated by a belief, that this would be
agreeable to the king, Oates had the boldness, at the bar of the
House of Commons, to utter these words, in his affected phraseology,
"Aye, Taitus Oates, accause Catherine, Quean of England,
of haigh traison!" The grounds of his accusation are stated in
the trial of Wakeman, the queen's physician, who, he alleged, was
bribed with 15,000l to poison the king, in case he should escape
the poniard of a Jesuit, named Coniers, and the pistols of Pickering
and Groves. Oates then swore, that three Jesuits carried him
with them to Somerset-house, where they were summoned to attend
the Queen; that he remained in an anti-chamber when they
were ushered into her presence; that he heard a female voice say,
she would assist Sir George Wakeman in his project, and would no
longer bear these repeated violations of her bed. When the fathers
came out, he desired to see the queen, and when admitted
into the anti-chamber, whence the female voice had proceeded,
he saw the queen, who smiled graciously on him, and there
was no other woman present. These impudent stories, with some
blunders into which the best-breathed witness may fall, saved
Wakeman's life.</p>

<p>The King immediately saw the tendency of this charge, and observed,
"They think I have a mind for a new wife; but for all
that, I will not see an innocent woman abused;" and certainly,
had he given way to it, the Queen would have been in great danger.</p>

<p>James Butler, Duke, Marquis, and Earl of Ormond, Earl of
Ossory and Brecknock, &amp;c. &amp;c. was as illustrious for his talents,
as for his rank, and distinguished by virtues superior to both. In
the difficult and dangerous situation of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,
he had to maintain the cause of Charles I. in that kingdom, with
very slender means, at once against the confederated Irish Catholics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and the parliamentary forces, the more formidable, though
less numerous, enemies of the royal cause. In 1649, he was able,
through consummate skill, both as a politician and general, to boast
that he had reduced almost all Ireland under the royal authority,
excepting the cities of Dublin and Londonderry. But Cromwell's
arrival, with 8000 disciplined and veteran forces, effectually changed
the scene. His first exploit was the storm of Tredagh, or Drogheda,
where the besiegers put the whole garrison to the sword,
and committed the most dreadful excesses of barbarity. After
this terrible example of severity, hardly any of the royal garrisons
could be prevailed on to make such a defence, as might expose
them to the same extremity. Wexford, and New Ross, both very
strong places, surrendered without a blow; all the forces under
Lord Inchiquin revolted to the side of the parliament; and, at
length, in 1650, Ormond saw himself under the necessity of abandoning
the kingdom, which he had so long and valiantly defended.
From Ireland he retreated to France, and accompanied King
Charles during his exile. He was much trusted by that prince; and
was charged with the task of withdrawing the Duke of Gloucester
from the family of the queen mother, Henrietta, who was making
every possible attempt to induce him to change his religion. This
delicate commission he executed with dexterity and success. He
had afterwards the satisfaction to forward a reconciliation between
the king and his mother, who had been on bad terms on account of
the queen's imprudent interference with her son's religious tenets.
At the Restoration, the Marquis of Ormond, for such was then
his title, was liberally rewarded, in lands and honours, for his steady
attachment to the royal party. He was created Duke of Ormond
in Ireland, and appointed steward of the household, groom of the
stole, and privy counsellor for the three kingdoms. In 1661, he
was made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. As the duke was a steady
friend of the great Clarendon, his services, and faithful zeal for
the king's real interests, did not prevent his sharing in the disgrace
of the chancellor. He had quarrelled with Lady Castlemaine,
then the favourite mistress, who gave vent to her rage in the most
abusive reproaches, and finally told the duke, she hoped to see
him hanged; to which he made the memorable reply, that, far from
wishing her ladyship's days shortened in return, his greatest desire
was <em>to see her grow old</em>. When Clarendon was banished, the prevailing
party, and especially the Duke of Buckingham, entertained
a design of impeaching the Duke of Ormond, and succeeded so far as
to deprive him of the lieutenancy of Ireland. The profligate Buckingham
agitated a still darker project, and is supposed to have
hired the famous Blood to attempt the assassination of his rival,
in which the ruffian had nearly succeeded. When Blood was
afterwards taken in his attempt to steal the regalia, the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
being desirous to spare his life, sent to Ormond to intimate
his wish, that his grace would consent to the proposed pardon.
Ormond nobly answered, if his majesty could forgive him
the stealing of his crown, he might easily pardon the assault
on his life. The gallant Earl of Ossery,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> who guessed whence the
attempt originally proceeded, seeing the Duke of Buckingham
shortly afterwards in the presence, charged him with being the author
of the intended assassination; and added, "if his father came
to a violent end, he should be at no loss to know the author,
should consider Buckingham as the murderer, and pistol him, if
he stood behind the king's chair: this" he boldly added, "I tell
you in the king's presence, that you may be sure I shall keep my
word." It does not appear that this spirited speech met either a
retort from Buckingham, or a check from the king. Although
the Duke of Ormond escaped the more open, as well as the more
secret practices of his enemies, he experienced much coldness
from the king, partly on account of his disliking the French intrigues,
and partly because he disdained to pay court to the royal
mistresses. Yet he would not throw up the staff, which he held
as lord-steward of the household, but continued his attendance on
court with as much punctuality as if in the highest favour. This
mode of conduct greatly embarrassed the good-natured, though
unprincipled Charles, to whom Ormond's silent and unreproachful
attentions were the most cutting memento of his own ingratitude.
On one occasion, the king appeared so much confused, that the
Duke of Buckingham asked him, whether he had lost the Duke of
Ormond's favour, or Ormond had lost his, since, of the two, his
majesty seemed most out of countenance?&mdash;In this neglected situation,
the duke used good-humouredly to compare himself to an
old neglected rusty clock; "yet, even that," said he, "points right
once in the twelve hours, and so perhaps may I." On another occasion,
when Colonel Cary Dillon pressed him for his interest
with the king, and said, he had no friend at court, save God and
his grace,&mdash;"Alas! poor Cary," said the duke, "thou couldst
not have two friends who have so little influence there, and are so
much neglected." During all the king's coldness, the duke never
altered his political principles, although Charles carried his estrangement
to the pitch of not even speaking to him. His opinion
of Shaftesbury, and his party, may be learned from an incident
which happened during his disgrace at court. "The day that the
Earl of Shatesbury was declared lord-chancellor, the king broke
through his ordinary rule (of not addressing the duke) and either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
in doubt about the wisdom of the step he had taken, or out of curiosity
to know the Duke of Ormond's sentiments of it, went up to
him, and, taking him aside to a window, asked what he thought
of his giving the seals to Lord Shaftesbury, whether he had done
prudently or not? His grace replied, you have doubtless acted
very prudently in so doing, if you know how to get them from
him again." <cite>Carte</cite>, Vol. II. p. 462. At length, after the duke
had attended court for a year without receiving a civil word from
his sovereign, he suddenly received a message, that the king meant
to sup with him. At the entertainment, no word of explanation
took place, although the ancient cordiality between the king and
his subject seemed to be fully restored. The next day, when the
duke came to the court, as usual, the king observed, "Yonder
comes Ormond; I have done all I can to disoblige him, and render
him as discontented as others; but he will be loyal in spite of
my teeth: I must even take him in again, as the fittest man to govern
Ireland." Accordingly, the duke was restored to his office
of lord-lieutenant in 1677.</p>

<p>He held this high situation during the ferment occasioned
by the Popish plot; and although, according to Oates and Bedloe's
information, one branch of that conspiracy was the murder of
the duke, yet he did not escape suspicion of being accessary to it
any more than the king, who was in the same predicament. Lord
Shaftesbury, in the parliament of 1679, insinuated an accusation
against the duke, on account of the alleged favour he shewed to
Papists. From this charge he was vindicated by the Earl of Ossory,
with an uncommon degree of spirited eloquence. Alter pleading
his father's services against the Roman Catholic rebels, the danger
of assassination from them which he had repeatedly escaped, and the
active share he had in preventing the perversion of the Duke of
Gloucester from the Protestant faith, he thus retorted upon Shaftesbury;
"Having spoke of what he has done, I presume with the
same truth to tell your lordship what he has not done. He never
advised the breaking the triple league; he never advised the shutting
up of the exchequer; he never advised the declaration for a
toleration; he never advised the falling out with the Dutch, and
the joining with France; he was not the author of that most excellent
position, <cite>Delenda est Carthago</cite>; that Holland, a Protestant
country, should, contrary to the true interest of England, be totally
destroyed. I beg your lordship will be so just, as to judge of
my father, and of all men, according to their actions and counsels."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
Shaftesbury, abashed at this summary of his former political
conduct, so different from that he was now pursuing, retracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
his accusation with some symptoms of confusion. It remained,
however, a capital object with the Whigs, to remove, if possible,
the Duke of Ormond from the management of Ireland, at least
to put in such a council as should trammel his measures. The
King's firmness disconcerted both these plans. At the momentous
period when Shaftesbury was committed to the Tower, the
Duke of Ormond was sent for to England, that his presence might
add respectability and weight to the king's councils. He entered
the city with great pomp; and was every where received with the
veneration due to his rank, his age, and his services. He had
never linked himself to any political faction; contented to serve
the crown upon the old cavalier principles, which he always asserted.
He was thought, however, to go too great lengths in advising
the king to maintain his authority by harsh measures;
nor were his experience and authority sufficient to prevent much
confused jarring in the king's councils, betwixt Halifax, who was for
holding the scales even between the factions, and the high-flying
Tories, who were posting towards arbitrary power. Yet, as a steady
supporter of the interests of the crown, particularly in the course
of the city elections, he deserved the honour which Dryden has
assigned him, of standing the first in the file of the king's friends.</p>

<p>The King was pleased to reward the services of Ormond by
giving him the rank of an English Duke, in 1682. After having
been so long threatened with removal, as a favourer of the Papists,
he was actually deprived of the lieutenancy of Ireland, in 1684,
for not being disposed to second James II. in the countenance
which he meant to afford that sect. The great Duke of Ormond,
to which epithet he has a just title, died on the 21 July, 1688,
without witnessing the second banishment of the house of Stewart.</p>

<p>This great statesman was a particular patron of Dryden, as is
evident from the dedication of "Plutarch's Lives;" where our
author again expresses his respect for the father, and his regret
for the son. After the death of both, our poet continued to enjoy
the countenance of their successor, James, second Duke of Ormond,
son of the gallant Ossory, to whom he has dedicated the
Fables.</p>

<p>The Duke of Ormond had eight sons, and two daughters. Six
of those sons were dead in 1681, when this poem was published.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
He, over whom Dryden pours forth this lamentation, was the gallant
Thomas, Earl of Ossory, whom, in the last note, we have exhibited
as the guardian of his father's life and reputation. At the
age of twenty-one, his external appearance and accomplishments
are thus described by one who knew him well:<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> "He is a young
man, with a very handsome face, a good head of hair, a pretty big
voice, well set, and a good round leg. He pleaseth me exceedingly;
being very good-natured, asking many questions, and humouring
the answers. He rides the great horse very well, is a good
tennis player, fencer, and dancer. He understands music, and
plays on the guittar and lute; speaks French eloquently, reads
Italian fluently; is a good historian, and so well versed in romances,
that, if a gallery be full of pictures, or hangings, he will tell
the story of all that are there described. He shuts up his door at
eight o'clock in the evening, and studies till midnight. He is temperate,
courteous, and excellent in all his behaviour." When the
Duke of Ormond went into exile, his son was imprisoned by Cromwell,
but, being afterwards released, he went abroad. In 1659, he
married the daughter of Beverwaert, governor of Sluys, a leading
man in the States-General. Upon the Restoration, he was promoted
in the army, which did not prevent his exerting his gallantry
on another element; for, during the desperate action of four
days in 1666, upon hearing the sound of the cannon, he contrived
to get off from Harwich, and to get on board the Duke of Albemarle,
to whom he brought the first news, that Prince Rupert
was recalled to support him. He distinguished himself by his
bravery during the battle in Southwold Bay, and by his liberality
to the wounded seamen after the action. In 1673 he was made rear-admiral
of the blue squadron; and, in the great battle in which
Sir Edward Spragge was killed, he lay by to defend and bring off
that admiral's disabled vessel. He is said to have formed a plan
for revenging the surprise at Chatham, by a descent at Helvoetsluys;
when he averred he would burn the Royal Charles, which the
Dutch preserved as a trophy, and the whole Dutch fleet, with a half-penny
candle, or consent, in case of failure, that his head should be
placed beside Cromwell's on Westminster-Hall. But the scheme
was not attempted; being prevented, it is said, by the envious interposition
of Buckingham. In November 1674, the Earl of Ossory had
the honour to be intrusted with the charge of arranging the match
between the Prince of Orange and the Lady Mary. He served under
the prince against the French with great credit, particularly
in the famous battle of Mons, fought 1678, where, with the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
regiments under his command, he executed with glory the
desperate service of beating the French out of their entrenchments.
In April 1680, he was designed Governor of Tangiers, an appointment
with which he was highly pleased; for his courage, being of a
romantic and wild nature, delighted in the prospect of being opposed
to such uncommon adversaries as the Moors. But, while he
was busily preparing for his departure, he was seized with a malignant
fever, during the delirium of which his mind was observed
constantly to be occupied with his intended exploits against the
besiegers of Tangiers.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> He died on the 30th July, 1680, aged forty-six
years. The lamentation for his loss was general and excessive;
the noble reply of his venerable father, to those who offered him
consolation, is well known: "Since he had borne the death of
his king, he could support," he said, "that of his child; and
would rather have his dead son, than any living son in Christendom."</p>

<p>The Earl of Ossory was a patron of learning; and was mourned,
both in verse and prose, by many other writers, as well as
Dryden. Settle, who then seems to have been in the Tory interest,
published a heroic poem on his death. Flatman wrote a
pindaric ode on the same occasion; for which he received, from
the Duke of Ormond, a diamond ring of 100 guineas value.&mdash;See
WOOD'S <cite>Athenæ Oxon</cite>. There is another ode written by K. C.,
perhaps Katherine Cockburn; finally, one bard, resolving to amuse
the nation's mourning by his own, dedicates to Ossory's memory
some exquisite stanzas, beginning thus: "Upon the Earl of Ossory,
who died of a fever, 30th July, 1680."</p>

<p>Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, was, in principle and practice,
a rigid high-church man. He even harboured notions favourable
to the celibacy of the clergy, and other ascetic doctrines
of the church of Rome. Burnet says, "that he was a man of
solemn deportment, sullen gravity, and some learning." He made
profession of the old cavalier faith and principles of loyalty,
which rendered him acceptable to the court and the high-church
party in general, although his temper was austere and reserved,
and his manners dry and distant. Yet the Archbishop, though
so harshly described by his brother of Sarum, displayed, on one
urgent occasion, a becoming readiness to assert the doctrine of the
church of England against those of Rome; and on another, the
steadiness of his own political principles, although his adherence,
in both instances, exposed him to persecution from those in power.
While the head of the high-church party, this primate was the
first to encourage the bishops and clergy to a refusal to read the
king's declaration of indulgence; he concerted also, and signed
the memorable petition, for which, with six other prelates, he suffered
imprisonment and trial, by one of the most imprudent exertions
of power which an infatuated monarch ever attempted. On
the 16th of July, 1688, this primate recommended a set of articles
to the bishops within his metropolitan jurisdiction, inculcating
residence and attention to parochial duties; but especially,
that the clergy should take heed of Romish emissaries, who, like
the old serpent, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">insidiantur calcaneo</i>, and besiege the beds of dying
persons, to unsettle their faith. He also recommends a tender regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to their "brethren, the protestant dissenters," and an union
with them against the church of Rome. At the Revolution, the
Archbishop was one of those privy counsellors who invited the
Prince of Orange to take charge of the government; but as
his principles did not permit him to accede to any step for removing
King James from the throne, he declined sitting in the
Convention of the estates. In conformity to the same principles,
he refused to take the oaths of allegiance to the Revolution
government; and was, in consequence, first suspended, and
finally deprived of his dignity, in which he was succeeded by
the famous Tillotson. He was regarded by the high-church party
as a confessor, if not a martyr, for the doctrine of passive obedience.
Sancroft died in 1693.</p>

<p>Compton, Bishop of London, was youngest son of the late, and
brother to the then Earl of Northampton. He had been a soldier
until he was thirty and upwards, when he exchanged the
sword for the gown. He is said by Burnet to have been a great
hater of Popery, and exact in performing the duties of his diocese;
but unlearned, weak, and wilful. He was a high-church man,
and held some reputation in the party, from his personal rank,
and the dignity of his situation. In other respects, the bishop
seems to have been good-tempered and hospitable, but much at
the devotion of the Earl of Danby, who had early assisted him
with his patronage. Although the Duke of York hated Compton,
yet the charge of the education of the Princesses Mary and
Anne devolved upon him. In the reign of James II., he distinguished
himself in the House of Peers, by a severe rebuff to the
insolence of Jefferies, the Chancellor. Soon after, the Bishop was
cited before the illegal court, called the Ecclesiastical Commission,
to answer for having refused to obey the king's command, by suspending
Sharpe, a clergyman, who had preached a sermon against
Popery. He requested a copy of their commission; but Jefferies,
with his usual violence, told him, he might have it for a penny
in any coffeehouse, and he might believe, in the mean while, that
they were not such fools as to sit there without an effectual one.
After some delay, he was suspended from his function, until the
news of the Prince of Orange's intended expedition, when his suspension
was removed. The credit which the bishop acquired
by this persecution, amounted to what Mulgrave called a "reverential
popularity, which," his lordship adds, "he of all the
bishops would have found it most difficult to have acquired otherwise."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
This led to the Bishop of London playing what, considering
his age and situation, was rather a remarkable part in
the Revolution; when Prince George of Denmark went over to
the Prince of Orange, and the princess, his wife, afterwards Queen
Anne, either fearing the resentment of her father, or determined
by the councils of Lady Churchill, (afterwards the famous
Duchess of Marlborough,) resolved to leave Whitehall, and abandon
her father's party. The Bishop acted as her escort on this
occasion; and, the time and circumstances reviving his military
habits, he rode before her coach to Northampton, with pistols
at his saddle, and a drawn sword in his hand. It may easily
be believed, that Dryden did not greatly approve of this last exploit
of his hospitable and noble Sagan; and he has left a pretty
strong testimony of his latter opinion, if the verses called "<i>Suum
Cuique</i>" are really written by him:</p>

<p>Dolben, Bishop of Rochester, and Dean of Westminster, had
borne arms in his youth for Charles I., who made him a major.
He was, according to Burnet, an excellent preacher, but a man
of more spirit than discretion, and imprudent in his behaviour.
He is unanimously allowed to have been a good-natured easy man,
of most amiable manners. In 1683, he was promoted to the see
of York, and made a very good archbishop. Dolben died in

<p>Adriel is the Earl of Mulgrave, afterwards Marquis of Normanby
and Duke of Buckingham. He was one of Dryden's most
early and effectual patrons. The "Essay upon Satire" was their
joint composition, and Dryden inscribed to him his play of "Aureng-Zebe."
The praise bestowed by Dryden is, as usual, discriminating
and appropriate. Mulgrave exhibits his "sharp judgement"
in his "Essay on Poetry," which contains some good critical
remarks; but of his lordship's poetical talents we have spoken
sufficiently elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> His political principles were those of
a staunch Tory, which he maintained through his whole life; and
was zealous for the royal prerogative, although he had no small
reason to complain of Charles II., who, to avenge himself of Mulgrave,
for a supposed attachment to the Princess Anne, sent him
to Tangiers, at the head of some troops, in a leaky vessel, which
it was supposed must have perished in the voyage. Though Mulgrave
was apprized of the danger, he scorned to shun it; and the
Earl of Plymouth, a favourite son of the king, generously insisted
upon sharing it along with him. This ungenerous attempt to destroy
him, in the very act of performing his duty, with the refusal
of a regiment, made a temporary change in Mulgrave's conduct.
He connected himself for a time with the country party;<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>soon returned to his original principles, and continued steadily to
support the court during the progress of the Exclusion Bill, and in
all the stormy debates of the troubled period to which Dryden's
poem refers. Yet he evinced, that he was not a "slave of state;"
for, although James II. made him Lord High Chamberlain, he
withstood all the measures which that ill-advised prince adopted
in behalf of the Catholic religion. He silenced a priest, who was
labouring for his conversion, and had begun with the doctrine of
transubstantiation, by the famous repartee, that "though he believed
God made man, he could not believe that man was quits by
making God in return." But he stood gallantly by King James to
the very last, and had the courage to insist upon the council taking
measures for the safety of that unfortunate monarch's person,
when, after his first flight, he was seized by the sailors at Feversham.</p>

<p>Dryden says, Adriel was adorned with the "honours torn from his
disobedient son;" because, when Monmouth was deprived of the
government of Hull and lieutenancy of Yorkshire, the king conferred
them upon the Earl of Mulgrave.</p>

<p>Sir George Saville, Viscount, Earl, and at length Marquis of
Halifax, was the prime minister of Charles during the last years
of his reign. He was a man of fine genius and lively imagination;
but, as a politician, was guided rather by a desire to display the
full extent of artful and nice management of parties, than by any
steady or consistent principle of his own. He was at the head of the
small party called Trimmers, who affected a sort of neutrality between
the Whig and Tory factions, and were, of course, suspected
and hated by both. He originally made a figure in opposition to
the court, particularly upon the great debates concerning the test,
which he keenly opposed. He voted at first for the bill of Exclusion;
and used the jocular argument against hereditary government,
that no man would chuse a man to drive his carriage,
merely because his father had been a good coachman. But when
that great question came finally to be debated in the House of
Lords, on the 15th November, 1680, Halifax had changed his opinion;
and he even conducted the opposition to the bill, and displayed
an extent of capacity and eloquence, equally astonishing to friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and foes, and which, perhaps, never was surpassed in that assembly.
Even Shaftesbury sank before this versatile orator; and
there seems little doubt, that his eloquence had a great effect in deciding
the issue of that day's famous debate, by which the Exclusion
Bill was thrown out for ever. The House of Commons was so much
incensed against Halifax, that they voted an address for his removal
from the king's councils. The king, however, found his own advantage
in the fine and balancing policy of Halifax; and, far from consenting
to his disgrace, promoted him to the rank of Marquis, and
office of Privy Seal, which was hardly more displeasing to the Whigs
than to the Duke of York. To the over-bearing measures of this
prince, Halifax was secretly a determined opponent; it was his
uniform object to detach Monmouth so far from the violent councils
and party of Shaftesbury, that the interest which he still retained
in the king's affections might be employed as a counterbalance
to that of his brother. He prevailed upon the king to see
Monmouth, after the discovery of the Rye-house Plot; and, had
the duke then proved more practicable, it is possible, that, backed
with the interest of Halifax, he might have regained his place
in the king's favour. Upon this occasion, the Duke of York was
not consulted, and made open show of his displeasure. Indeed
Halifax told Sir John Reresby, that the Duke would never forgive
him.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> It is even said, that, immediately before the death of
Charles, there was a scheme in agitation, under the management
of Halifax, for recalling Monmouth, sending York to Scotland,
calling a parliament, and totally changing the violent measures of
the last two years.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> If so, it was prevented by the king's sudden
death, and left Halifax exposed to the resentment of his successor.
For some time, James, in consideration of his great services during
the dependence of the Bill of Exclusion, treated him with seeming
confidence; but finding him unwilling to go the lengths he proposed
in religious matters, and particularly in the proposed repeal
of the test acts, he was totally disgraced. Alter this period, the
Marquis of Halifax engaged with those lords who invited over
the Prince of Orange; and joined so cordially in the Revolution,
that he was made Keeper of the Seals by King William. He died
in April 1695.</p>

<p>Amidst the various political changes of this thorough-paced
statesman, it ought not to be forgotten, that, though he sided with
the court during the last years of King Charles, his councils were a
salutary check on the arbitrary measures urged by the Duke of York;
and that he probably merited the praise, which Dryden elsewhere
bestows on him, "of preventing a civil war, and extinguishing
a growing fire, which was just ready to have broken forth."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Laurence Hyde, second son to the great Earl of Clarendon,
created Earl of Rochester by Charles II. Even after his father's
fall, he contrived to retain the confidence of Charles, and in 1676
was employed on an embassy to Poland. He was also one of the
plenipotentiaries at the treaty of Nimeguen, and for some time
ambassador in Holland; to which diplomatic situations Dryden
alludes in the text. He was named one of the commissioners of
the treasury in 1679, and had very considerable influence, by
which the poet reaped some advantage; for, notwithstanding the
exhausted state of the exchequer, he acknowledges, that, contrary
to the famous comparison of Cowley, Gideon's fleece had
been moistened, when all the ground around was parched. Rochester
was a steady opposer of the Bill of Exclusion, for which,
in 1681, he was voted a public enemy by the House of Commons.
Indeed, that measure must have materially affected the
interests of the Duke of York's daughters, to whom Rochester
stood in the relation of maternal uncle. For the same reason, as
well as from political principle, he as keenly withstood the Duke
of Monmouth s pretensions; for which he is stigmatised by Settle,
in lines of which the following is a specimen:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Of these, than subtile Caleb none more great;</div>
  <div class="i0">Caleb, who shines where his lost father set.</div>

  <div class="i0">Steering in that hereditary track,</div>
  <div class="i0">Blind to the sea-mark of a father's wrack.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the compliments bestowed by Dryden on Rochester
for his management of the exchequer, he was, when in the
high situation of Lord Treasurer, 1682, accused of peculation by
his rival Halifax, who so far prevailed, that Rochester was removed
to the more honourable but less important office, of President
of the Council; on which occasion his witty adversary first applied
the since well-known phrase, of "his lordship's being kicked
up stairs." After the accession of King James, Rochester was
again made Lord Treasurer, but soon lost the staff for his repugnance
to enter into the violent measures of that monarch. He had
consented to be present at a conference between some Catholic
and Protestant divines, but treated the arguments of the former
with a contempt which James could not forgive. At the Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
he observed a sullen neutrality; and, though uncle to Queen
Mary, never heartily acquiesced in her title to the crown, or reaped
any benefit from its being occupied by so near a relation.
King William never could forgive his once having passed through
the Low Countries without waiting upon him.</p>

<p>He was a particular patron of Dryden, who inscribed to him
the "Duke of Guise" and "Cleomenes," with expressions of
great gratitude and respect. See Vol. VII. p. 13. Vol. VIII.

<p>Edward Seymour, afterward Sir Edward Seymour, Bart., was
descended of the elder branch of the illustrious family of that
name, and was ancestor of the present Duke of Somerset. He is
said to have attached great importance to his high birth, and to
have been esteemed the proudest commoner in England. He was
speaker of the House of Commons under the Earl of Danby's
administration; a post which he filled with a mixture of dexterity
and dignity. Burnet says, he knew the House and every man of
it so well, that at one glance he could tell the fate of every motion.
This he used as a means of serving the court; contriving
usually to protract the debate when their party were not assembled
in strength. It was alleged by his enemies, that he was the
channel through which gratuities were distributed to the court
members; which charge is grossly urged in Settle's poem called
"Absalom Senior."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> These charges seem to be exaggerated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
at least it is certain, that Seymour's conduct as speaker was not
uniformly, or servilely, guided by devotion to the court; and
that he was acceptable to the Commons, for the Parliament, in
1679, chose him speaker anew, in opposition to Mr Meres, who
was proposed by the court party. But when Seymour was next day
presented as speaker to the king, he refused to receive him as
such, and said, he had indispensable occasion for his services in
another capacity. At this time the crown claimed a voice in the
nomination of the speaker, and the dispute became very warm,
till it was terminated by the king conceding, that the right of
election was in the House, upon their passing from the election of
Mr Seymour, and chusing Mr Sergeant Gregory. He was afterwards
made Treasurer of the Navy, and was in that office in 1680,
when an impeachment was moved against him for corruption and
mal-administration. But the House of Lords repelled the impeachment;
which seems only to have been founded in party
clamour. In the following year he was voted a public enemy,
for opposing the Bill of Exclusion. In the slavish parliament
of 1685, Seymour had the boldness to deliver a speech on the
irregularity of the elections, which had been much biassed by
the crown. He told the House, that many doubted whether
they were the true representatives of the people; and that little
justice was expected on petitions, where too many were guilty
to judge justly and impartially. He said, it concerned the House
to look to this; for, if the nation saw no equity was to be expected
from them, they might take means to make the members
suffer that justice which they would not grant. No one among
the astonished members had been aware of Seymour's intentions,
so none were prepared either to second or answer this
bold harangue. This statesman was a friend to the Revolution;
he joined the Prince of Orange at Exeter, and was the first to propose
that an association should be signed, without which, he observed,
the insurgents were as a rope of sand. On this occasion,
the Prince, meaning a compliment, asked Seymour if he was
not of the Duke of Somerset's family? "No, please your royal
highness," was the reply; "the Duke is of mine." This gave the
Prince the first idea of the conscious dignity of an English commoner.
William placed Devonshire under his government. In
the parliament of 1700-1, Sir Edward Seymour was active in detecting
the corrupt practices of elections, and received the thanks
of the House for having protected its constitution.</p>

<p>Spence, on the authority of a priest whom he often met at Mr
Pope's, has stated, that the king <em>obliged</em> Dryden to put his speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
to the Oxford Parliament into verse, and insert it at the close of
"Absalom and Achitophel." Mr Malone has extracted the following
parallel passages, which give some countenance to the tradition;
although Dryden is just as likely to have versified them of
his own accord as by the royal command; for this speech was
the talisman by which he was to extricate David from all his difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>In the case of the Earl of Danby, the King's power of granting
him a pardon was warmly disputed; it being supposed, that the
crown had no power to remit the penalty of high treason. So
far was this notion stretched, that, as we have already seen, the
sheriffs, Bethel and Cornish, contested, in the case of Lord Stafford,
the king's right to exchange the statutory punishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
hanging, drawing, and quartering, for that of beheading. They applied
by petition to the House of Commons to have their scruples
removed, and, <i>proh pudor!</i> received the countenance of Lord
Russell in this brutal scruple. The king did not forget this circumstance
when the writ was issued for Russell's execution: "He
shall find," said Charles, in appointing the commutation of punishment,
"that I have the privilege which he was pleased to
deny in the case of Lord Stafford."</p>

<p>The petitioners, mentioned immediately afterwards, are those
who called upon the king by petition to summon the parliament.
These applications were highly displeasing to Charles, whose followers,
to balance them, made equally violent addresses, expressing
their abhorrence of tumultuary petitions. Almost every
county and town was thus divided into petitioners, and addressers,
or abhorrers, as they were sometimes called. The former experienced,
on occasion of presenting their petitions, the royal frowns;
while the latter were in a very summary manner committed, by
the House of Commons, to the custody of their serjeant. This arbitrary
course was ended by the refusal of one Stowel to submit to
the arrest, which contempt the House were fain to pass over, by
voting that he was indisposed.</p>

<p>This is rather an imprudent avowal of what was actually the
policy of the court faction at this time. They contrived to turn
against Shaftesbury and his party, many of those very witnesses by
whom so many Catholics had been brought to execution. Dugdale,
Turberville, Haynes, and Smith, all of whom had been witnesses
of the plot, now came as readily forward to convict Colledge,
Howard, and Shaftesbury himself, of high treason. Such
infamous traffic ought to have deprived them of credit on all sides;

<h2>ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL.<br />

<span class="small70">PART SECOND.</span></h2>


<p>The sensation produced in London, and indeed throughout the
nation, by the first part of "Absalom and Achitophel," was so deep
and extended, as never had been before occasioned by a similar
performance. Neither was Dryden backward in pursuing the literary
victory which he had obtained over the Whigs. He published
"The Medal" upon the acquittal of the Earl of Shaftesbury, and
the rejoicings with which his party had celebrated that memorable
event. He even stooped to inferior game, and avenged himself
of Shadwell's repeated attacks upon his literary reputation,
his political principles, and his moral character, by the publication
of "Mac Flecnoe," one of the most severe satires in the
English language. Yet, according to the opinion of the royal
party, more still remained to be done. The heads of Shaftesbury's
faction had been held up to hatred, or ridicule, in "Absalom
and Achitophel;" his own life had been more closely scrutinized,
and his failings and crimes exposed more specifically in "The
Medal;" but something, they conceived, was wanting, to silence
and crush the underling writers and agitators of the party, and
Dryden's assistance was again invoked for this purpose, as well as
to celebrate some of the king's supporters and favourites, who
were necessarily omitted in the original poem. But Dryden, being
unwilling again to undertake a task upon which he had repeatedly
laboured, deputed Nahum Tate to be his assistant in a second
part of "Absalom and Achitophel;" reserving for himself only the
execution of certain particular characters, and the general plan
and revisal of the poem.</p>

<p>Of Tate, honoured with so high a trust by our great poet, biographers
have preserved but a very imperfect memorial. He was the son
of Dr Faithful Tate or Teat, was born in Ireland, and educated at
Trinity College, Dublin. He wrote, or rather new modelled and
translated, nine plays, of which, his alteration of King Lear still
keeps the stage, in defiance of its gross departure from Shakespeare's
plot and moral. During the reign of Charles and his successor,
Tate was a keen Tory, as may be easily guessed from Dryden's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
employing him in the honourable task of writing a second part to
his admirable satire; yet, upon Shadwell's death, he was made
poet laureat to King William, and retained that office till his own
decease. His talent for poetry amounted to cold mediocrity; had
he been a man of fortune, it would have raised him to the rank
of an easy sonnet writer, or a person of wit and honour about town.
As he was very poor, it is no disgrace to his muse, that she left him in
that indigence from which far more distinguished poetical merit
has been unable to raise those who possessed it. Tate died in the
Mint, where he had taken refuge from his creditors, on the 12th
of August, 1715. He had long been in extreme want, having
owed almost his sole subsistence to the patronage or charity of the
Earl of Dorset. His poetry is multifarious; but consists chiefly
of pieces upon occasional subjects, written to supply the immediate
wants of the author. The Psalms, of which he executed
a translation, in conjunction with Dr Brady, are still used in
the church of England, although, in the opinion of many persons,
they are inferior to the old version.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>The following continuation of "Absalom and Achitophel,"
owes all its spirit to the touches and additions of the author of
the first part. Those lines, to the number of two hundred, beginning,</p>

<p class="center">Next these a troop of busy spirits press;</p>

<p>and concluding,</p>

<p class="center">To talk like Doeg, and to write like thee,</p>

<p>are entirely composed by Dryden, and contain some of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
masterly strokes of his pen. The portraits of Doeg and Og, under
which names he stigmatized his personal antagonists, Settle and
Shadwell, are executed with a strength of satirical colouring, unmatched
in the English language. When we consider that Dryden
had already, and very lately, made Shadwell the subject of
an entire independent satire, it seems wonderful, with what ease
he has executed a separate, and even more striking, caricature of
his adversary, without repeating an idea or expression which he
had used in "Mac Flecnoe." This is, indeed, partly owing to the
dexterous division of his subject, as well as to the rich fertility of
his vein of satire. For, after apparently exhausting upon his enemy
all the opprobrium and contempt with which a literary character
could be loaded, he seized this second occasion to brand
and blacken his political and moral principles, and to exaggerate
his former charge of dulness, by combining it with those of sedition,
profaneness, and immorality. The characters of Ben Jochanan,
Judas, Phaleg, &amp;c. are all drawn with the same spirit
and vivacity; and, on the whole, these lines are equal to any of
the kind which our author ever wrote.</p>

<p>Had Dryden limited his assistance to furnishing this fragment,
he would rather have injured than served his coadjutor, since it
would have shone like a lamp in a dungeon, only to show the
dreary waste in which it was inclosed. To prevent Tate from suffering
too much by comparison, Dryden has obviously contributed
much to the poem at large. Still, though Tate's lines have
doubtless been weeded of much that would at once have ascertained
their origin, our author's own couplet might have been addressed
to Nahum on the assistance lent him. Dryden's spirit is</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;so transfused, as oil and waters flow;</div>
  <div class="i0">His always floats above, thine sinks below.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Much of the character of Corah, for example, is unquestionably
Dryden's; so probably is that of Arod, and the verses generally
descriptive of the Green-ribbon Club, which precede it.
Such pungent satire is easily distinguished from the smooth insipid
flow of other parts in which Dryden's corrections probably
left nothing for censure, and which fate was unable to qualify with
any thing entitled to praise. The character of Michal, of Dryden
as Asaph, and some of the encomiastic passages, seem to show
the extent of Tate's powers, when unsupported by the vivifying
assistance of his powerful auxiliary. They are just decently versified,
but flat, common-place, and uninteresting.</p>

<p>The second part of "Absalom and Achitophel" shared the
fate of most continuations, and did not attain the popularity of
the original. This was not entirely owing to the general inferiority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of the poetry; for there was enough of personal satire, and that
immediately flowing from the keen pen of Dryden, to secure the
attention both of friends and foes; but the parallel between the
heroes of Scripture and the characters of the day, however striking
at first, did not bear to be too long protracted. When the
original comparison was made, its aptness at once pleased the
imagination, and arrested the attention; but when prolonged in a
second part, readers began to see there was little wit in continuing
to draw out the allusion, till it consisted in nothing more
than the invention of a Jewish name for a British author or statesman;
the attempt at finding prototypes in Scripture for every modern
character being necessarily abandoned. Besides, those who took
it upon them to answer Dryden, had in general made use of the
vehicle of satire which he had invented; and as, in the eyes of the
public, the theme became stale and tarnished by repetition, his antagonists
did him that injury by their stupidity, which their wit was
unequal to accomplish. Add to all this, that whole lines, and even
longer passages, not to mention images and sentiments, are by
Tate, in his poverty of ideas, transferred from the first part of the
satire to the second;<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and we must allow, that the latter is deficient
in the captivating grace of novelty.</p>

<p>The second part of "Absalom and Achitophel" appeared about
November 10th, 1682, in folio. Tonson is the publisher.</p>

  <div class="i0">That madly their own happiness oppose;</div>
  <div class="i0">There heaven itself, and god-like kings, in vain</div>
  <div class="i0">Shower down the manna of a gentle reign;</div>

  <div class="i0">His rights to invade, his tributes to refuse,</div>
  <div class="i0">A privilege peculiar to the Jews;</div>
  <div class="i0">As if from heavenly call this licence fell,</div>

  <div class="i0">While fond of change, though ne'er so dearly bought,</div>
  <div class="i0">Our tribes outstrip the youth's ambitious thought;</div>
  <div class="i0">His swiftest hopes with swifter homage meet,</div>
  <div class="i0">And crowd their servile necks beneath his feet.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus to his aid while pressing tides repair,</div>
  <div class="i0">He mounts, and spreads his streamers in the air.</div>
  <div class="i0">The charms of empire might his youth mislead,</div>
  <div class="i0">But what can our besotted Israel plead?</div>
  <div class="i0">Swayed by a monarch, whose serene command</div>
  <div class="i0">Seems half the blessing of our promised land;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose only grievance is excess of ease,</div>
  <div class="i0">Freedom our pain, and plenty our disease!</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet as all folly would lay claim to sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">And wickedness ne'er wanted a pretence,</div>
  <div class="i0">With arguments they'd make their treason good,</div>

  <div class="i0">Whose very chiefs, convict, were never freed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nay we have seen their sacrifices bleed!</div>
  <div class="i0">Accuser's infamy is urged in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">While in the bounds of sense they did contain;</div>
  <div class="i0">But soon they launcht into the unfathomed tide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in the depths they knew disdained to ride;</div>
  <div class="i0">For probable discoveries to dispense,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was thought below a pensioned evidence;</div>
  <div class="i0">Mere truth was dull, nor suited with the port</div>

  <div class="i0">Such was the charge on pious Michal<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> brought;</div>
  <div class="i0">Michal, that ne'er was cruel even in thought;</div>
  <div class="i0">The best of queens, and most obedient wife,</div>
  <div class="i0">Impeached of curst designs on David's life!</div>
  <div class="i0">His life, the theme of her eternal prayer,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis scarce so much his guardian angel's care.</div>
  <div class="i0">Not summer morns such mildness can disclose,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Hermon lily, nor the Sharon rose.</div>
  <div class="i0">Neglecting each vain pomp of majesty,</div>
  <div class="i0">Transported Michal feeds her thoughts on high.</div>
  <div class="i0">She lives with angels, and, as angels do,</div>
  <div class="i0">Quits heaven sometimes to bless the world below;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where, cherished by her bounteous plenteous spring,</div>
  <div class="i0">Reviving widows smile, and orphans sing.</div>
  <div class="i0">Oh! when rebellious Israel's crimes at height,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are threatened with her Lord's approaching fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">The piety of Michal then remain</div>
  <div class="i0">In heaven's remembrance, and prolong his reign!</div>
  <div class="i1">Less desolation did the pest pursue,</div>

  <div class="i0">With gentler terror these our state o'er-ran,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than since our evidencing days began!</div>
  <div class="i0">On every cheek a pale confusion sat,</div>
  <div class="i0">Continued fear beyond the worst of fate!</div>
  <div class="i0">Trust was no more, art, science, useless made,</div>
  <div class="i0">All occupations lost but Corah's trade.</div>
  <div class="i0">Meanwhile a guard on modest Corah wait,</div>

  <div class="i0">Well might he deem each peer and prince his slave,</div>
  <div class="i0">And lord it o'er the tribes which he could save:</div>

  <div class="i0">Even vice in him was virtue&mdash;what sad fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">But for his honesty, had seized our state?</div>
  <div class="i0">And with what tyranny had we been curst,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had Corah never proved a villain first?</div>
  <div class="i0">To have told his knowledge of the intrigue in gross,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had been, alas, to our deponent's loss:<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">The travelled Levite had the experience got,</div>
  <div class="i0">To husband well, and make the best of's plot;</div>
  <div class="i0">And therefore, like an evidence of skill,</div>
  <div class="i0">With wise reserves secured his pension still;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor quite of future power himself bereft,</div>
  <div class="i0">But limbos large for unbelievers left,</div>
  <div class="i0">And now his writ such reverence had got,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas worse than plotting to suspect his plot:</div>
  <div class="i0">Some were so well convinced, they made no doubt</div>
  <div class="i0">Themselves to help the foundered swearers out;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some had their sense imposed on by their fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">But more for interest sake believe and swear:</div>
  <div class="i0">Even to that height with some the frenzy grew,</div>
  <div class="i0">They raged to find their danger not prove true.</div>
  <div class="i1">Yet, than all these a viler crew remain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who with Achitophel the cry maintain;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not urged by fear, nor through misguided sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">(Blind zeal and starving need had some pretence,)</div>
  <div class="i0">But for the good old cause, that did excite</div>
  <div class="i0">The original rebel's wiles,&mdash;revenge, and spite.</div>
  <div class="i0">These raise the plot, to have the scandal thrown</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon the bright successor of the crown,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose virtue with such wrongs they had pursued,</div>
  <div class="i0">As seemed all hope of pardon to exclude.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, while on private ends their zeal is built,</div>
  <div class="i0">The cheated crowd applaud and share their guilt.</div>
  <div class="i1">Such practices as these, too gross to lie</div>
  <div class="i0">Long unobserved by each discerning eye,</div>
  <div class="i0">The more judicious Israelites unspelled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Though still the charm the giddy rabble held;</div>
  <div class="i0">Even Absalom, amidst the dazzling beams</div>
  <div class="i0">Of empire, and ambition's flattering dreams,</div>

  <div class="i0">And, filial sense yet striving in his breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus to Achitophel his doubts exprest.</div>
  <div class="i1">Why are my thoughts upon a crown employed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, once obtained, can be but half enjoyed?</div>
  <div class="i0">Not so when virtue did my arms require,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to my father's wars I flew entire.</div>
  <div class="i0">My regal power how will my foes resent,</div>
  <div class="i0">When I myself have scarce my own consent?</div>
  <div class="i0">Give me a son's unblemished truth again,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or quench the sparks of duty that remain.</div>
  <div class="i0">How slight to force a throne that legions guard,</div>
  <div class="i0">The task to me; to prove unjust, how hard!</div>
  <div class="i0">And if the imagined guilt thus wound my thought,</div>
  <div class="i0">What will it, when the tragic scene is wrought?</div>
  <div class="i0">Dire war must first be conjured from below,</div>
  <div class="i0">The realm we'd rule we first must overthrow;</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And when the civil furies are on wing,</div>

  <div class="i0">Oh! rather let me perish in the strife,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than have my crown the price of David's life!</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, if the tempest of the war he stand,</div>
  <div class="i0">In peace, some vile officious villain's hand</div>
  <div class="i0">His soul's anointed temple may invade,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, prest by clamorous crowds, myself be made</div>
  <div class="i0">His murtherer; rebellious crowds, whose guilt</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall dread his vengeance till his blood be spilt;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which if my filial tenderness oppose,</div>
  <div class="i0">Since to the empire by their arms I rose,</div>
  <div class="i0">Those very arms on me shall be employed,</div>
  <div class="i0">A new usurper crowned, and I destroyed:</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The same pretence of public good will hold,</div>

  <div class="i0">A smile that did his rising spleen disguise:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">My thoughts presumed our labours at an end,</div>
  <div class="i0">And are we still with conscience to contend?</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose want in kings as needful is allowed,</div>
  <div class="i0">As 'tis for them to find it in the crowd.</div>
  <div class="i0">Far in the doubtful passage you are gone,</div>
  <div class="i0">And only can be safe by pressing on.</div>
  <div class="i0">The crown's true heir, a prince severe and wise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Has viewed your motions long with jealous eyes;</div>
  <div class="i0">Your person's charms, your more prevailing arts,</div>
  <div class="i0">And marked your progress in the people's hearts.</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose patience is the effect of stinted power,</div>
  <div class="i0">But treasures vengeance for the fatal hour;</div>
  <div class="i0">And if remote the peril he can bring,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your present danger's greater from the king.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let not a parent's name deceive your sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor trust the father in a jealous prince!</div>
  <div class="i0">Your trivial faults if he could so resent,</div>
  <div class="i0">To doom you little less than banishment.</div>

  <div class="i0">Nor only so, but with a pomp more high,</div>
  <div class="i0">And open court of popularity,</div>
  <div class="i0">The factious tribes&mdash;And this reproof from thee?</div>
  <div class="i0">The prince replies,&mdash;O statesman's winding skill!</div>
  <div class="i0">They first condemn, that first advised the ill.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Illustrious youth, returned Achitophel,</div>

  <div class="i0">The course you steer I worthy blame conclude,</div>

  <div class="i0">A monarch's crown with fate surrounded lies;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who reach, lay hold on death that miss the prize.</div>
  <div class="i0">Did you for this expose yourself to shew,</div>

  <div class="i0">And must I here my shipwrecked arts bemoan?</div>
  <div class="i0">Have I for this so oft made Israel groan?</div>
  <div class="i0">Your single interest with the nation weighed,</div>

  <div class="i0">The privilege that statesmen ever claim;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who private interest never yet pursued,</div>

  <div class="i0">Even property, whose champion now you stand,</div>

  <div class="i0">Hence Tyre and Israel, low in ruins laid,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Egypt, once their scorn, their common terror made.</div>
  <div class="i0">Even yet of such a season can we dream,</div>

  <div class="i0">And place prerogative above the law;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which on your fall from office grew unjust,</div>
  <div class="i0">The laws made king, the king a slave in trust;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whom with state-craft, to interest only true,</div>
  <div class="i0">You now accuse of ills contrived by you.</div>
  <div class="i1">To this hell's agent:&mdash;Royal youth, fix here;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let interest be the star by which you steer.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hence, to repose your trust in me was wise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose interest most in your advancement lies;</div>
  <div class="i0">A tie so firm as always will avail,</div>

  <div class="i0">His strength as yet in David's friendship lies,</div>

<p>It is certain, that, whatever the private wishes of Charles may
have been, he neither did nor durst interfere, by his royal prerogative,
to prevent the execution of Stafford, Coleman, Langhorne,
Plunket, and other Catholics of rank, who were condemned on
account of the Popish Plot. Ireland, Fenwic, Gavan, Turner,
and Harcourt, Jesuits, with Whitebread, the provincial of the
order, were all tried, sentenced, and executed for the same
conspiracy; persisting, to their last breath, in the most solemn
and deliberate asseverations of innocence: But their dying testimonies
only irritated the populace the more against a religion,
which taught its votaries to go down to the grave with a manifest
lie, as they supposed, in their right hand.</p>

<p>The Parliament, before whom Oates was examined, did not
confine themselves to simple approbation of his conduct. He was
treated in a manner suitable to the sense they had of his merit and
importance. The charge of his personal safety was recommended
by the House of Commons to the Lord General, the care of his
lodgings and accommodation to the Lord Chamberlain, and that
of supplying him with money to the Lord High Treasurer of England.</p>

<p>The state of Oates, in his splendour, is very well described by
North: "He was now in his trine exaltation; his plot in full
force, efficacy, and virtue; he walked about with his guards, assigned
for fear of the Papists' murdering him. He had lodgings
at Whitehall, and L. 1200 <i>per annum</i> pension; and no wonder, after
he had the impudence to say to the House of Lords, in plain
terms, that, if they would not help him to more money, he must
be forced to help himself. He put on an episcopal garb, (except
the lawn sleeves,) silk gown and cassock, great hat, sattin hatband
and rose, long scarf, and was called, or blasphemously called
himself, the Saviour of the Nation. Whoever he pointed at
was taken up and committed; so that many people got out of his
way as from a blast, and glad they could prove their last two
years conversation. The very breath of him was pestilential; and
if it brought not imprisonment or death over such on whom it
fell, it surely poisoned reputation, and left good Protestants arrant
Papists, and something worse than that, in danger of being put
into the plot as traitors." <i>Examen.</i> p. 205.</p>

<p>Oates never would say he had told all he knew, but always reserved
some part of his evidence to be changed or altered with the
shifting wind of faction or popularity. According to his first narrative,
the plot was laid against the persons of the king and Duke of
York; and their assassination was to take place during the fire of
London. But he had the impudence to say, in his picture of
King James, that both his brother and he were in that very plot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
for firing the city, a secret which, he alleges, he could not discover
at the time, on account of a promise to Prince Rupert; and is
pleased to add, that the prince heartily repented of giving, and he
of taking, that counsel. When he was asked, in the House of
Commons, whether he had told all he knew of the conspiracy?
this cautious witness, who was determined to have the whole credit
of saving the kingdom his own way, instead of entrusting the
House with the secret, told them a parable of a fox, who, having
occasion to cross a frozen stream with a goose, and being unwilling to
hazard his spoil, first carried over a stone of equal weight with the
goose, to see if the ice would bear it. In short, neither he, nor
any of his imitators, would say more, than that their immediate
evidence was all which they as yet thought meet to declare.</p>

<p>This would have been tolerated no where but in England,
and during that period of terror, suspicion, and infatuation,
when these perjured caitiffs were as dear to the people as those
who tell stories of Rawhead and Bloody-bones are to their nursery
audience. The author has said, and with much truth,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Twas worse than plotting to suspect his plot.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The discovery of Coleman's letters, however irreconcileable
with the tale of the witnesses, above all, the murder of Godfrey,
gave such a bloody confirmation, that the people swallowed all
that could be told them about the horrors of the conspiracy;
and, to use the warm expression of the author of the "<i>Examen</i>,"
one might have denied his Redeemer with less contest than attainted
the veracity of Oates.</p>

<p>This popular ferment began to abate after the execution of
Lord Stafford; and, as the witnesses sunk in reputation, the king
began by degrees to discountenance Oates. He expelled him from
Whitehall, withdrew his guards, and reduced his pension to L.600.
Upon this Oates altered his dress, assumed a sword, and associated
with the more desperate of the popular faction, such as Rumbold,
Colledge, and Fergusson. In the reign of James II., his
fortunes suffered a yet more melancholy reverse; for, being most
satisfactorily convicted of perjury, by upwards of eighty witnesses,
he was sentenced to two fines of 1000 merks each; to be whipped,
on two different days, from Aldgate to Newgate, and from Newgate
to Tyburn; to be imprisoned for life, and to be pilloried five
times every year. James had the imprudence to exult in this
cruel punishment. He told Sir John Reresby, that the Popish
plot was now dead; and, when that courtier obsequiously answered,
"and buried, please your majesty," he thought the jest worth
repeating, which his brother would hardly have done. It is true,
no punishment could be bad enough for the author of so many
legal murders; but the severity of the sentence was an injury to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
the law of the land, though done through the person of so vile a
criminal. The man's impudence supported him under the conviction;
and his fortitude under the punishment was the means
of regaining a share of his fallen credit. After the Revolution, he
was pardoned, and received a pension of L.400, with the amount
of which he was much dissatisfied, as well as with the refusal of
the Parliament to reverse his sentence, and restore his capacity
for his old trade of bearing evidence.</p>

<p>North, and other Tory writers, have affected to consider Shaftesbury
as the original author of the Popish plot. Of this there is
no proof whatever; and the internal evidence derived from the
account of the plot itself, is altogether inconsistent with the very
idea. Shaftesbury could never have given birth to such a heap
of inconsistent fables; a plan which he had forged would have
been ingenious, consistent with itself, accommodated to the circumstances
of parties, and the times, and therefore, in all probability,
being less suited to the vulgar palate, would not have made
half the impression on the public. But we can easily believe the
truth of what he is alleged to have said, "that whoever started
the game, he had the full advantage of the chase." In fact, this
wonderful tale, probably at first invented by two or three obscure
knaves, with the sordid view of profiting by the credulity of the
English nation, would have fallen to the ground, had it not been
fostered and cherished by Shaftesbury, who very soon perceived
it could be made the means of turning out Lord Danby, and driving
matters to extremity against the Catholic faction. He might
well indeed exult in his management in the former particular,
since Danby was the first to introduce into the House of Commons
that very discussion about the plot, to which, as Shaftesbury
managed it, he himself fell a sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> But it was chiefly as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
means of bringing forward the Bill of Exclusion, and of crushing for
ever the hopes of his mortal foe the Duke of York,<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> that Shaftesbury
became the patron of all investigations connected with the
plot, pushed them on with vigour and vehemence, and dipped
himself deep in the blood of the innocent persons who fell sacrifices
to the popular clamour he had excited, and to evidence, which
much less than Shaftesbury's abilities might easily have discovered
to be inconsistent and fabulous.</p>

<p>A humorous pamphlet, already quoted, represents Shaftesbury
as abandoning his pretensions to the crown of Poland, for
the purpose of following up the discovery of the Popish plot.
"In the very height of all this expectation, one night as his majesty
elect lay musing upon his bed, restless with the thoughts and
expectation of the approaching empire, there appeared to him,
by the light of a lamp that was burning in his chamber, a dreadful
and most monstrous vision. The shape and figure of it was
very confused and irregular: sometimes it looked like the whore
of Babylon, naked, and of immense privities; presently, in the
twinkling of an eye, the form was changed, and it appeared like
a justice of the peace, strangled by a crew of ruffians, who afterwards
ran him through the body with his own sword, that it might
be thought he hanged himself; on a sudden it was altered again,
and seemed a troop of pilgrims, armed with black bills, that
came the Lord knows whence, landed the Lord knows where,
and are gone the Lord knows whither. His majesty seeing it
vary so often, and so terribly, calling up all the faith he had to
his assistance, boldly demanded 'In the name of, &amp;c. what art
thou?' Instantly, after a terrible clap of thunder, accompanied
with several flashes of lightning, it contracted itself into the shape
of a doctor of Salamanca, and, in a hideous tone, cried out, 'I
am a <span class="smcap">Plot</span>. Woe to England! farewell till 78;' and vanished.
No sooner was it gone, but a stupid amazement seized upon the
majesty of Poland, and cast him into a deep sleep, where he lay
till morning, when, awakening, he found himself stript of all the
high and aspiring thoughts that before had filled his mind; pity
and compassion towards his native country utterly cooled his ambition,
and from that moment he laid by all thoughts of converting
the Turk, and resolved to stay at home for confounding the
pope.</p>

<p>"Thus has this good man, (for he is no more his majesty,) again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
refused the highest promotion that perhaps any subject of England
was ever raised to, merely to stand in a gap here, and slay

<p>In 1679, the national discontent running exceedingly high,
both on account of the Popish plot, and for other reasons, the
king, by the advice of Sir William Temple, summoned a council
of thirty persons, fifteen of whom were the great officers of the
crown, and fifteen chosen from the country party. Shaftesbury
was made president of this council, against the opinion of Temple;
and quickly found the means of pressing his favourite measure of
the Exclusion Bill. Monmouth, upon whose interest in the king's
affections he had great reliance, was the person whom he proposed
to nominate as successor, either by a law to be passed for the purpose,
or by prevailing on the king to declare him legitimate. For
this purpose, the interest of Shaftesbury was exerted to have the
duke sent down to Scotland, to oppose the insurgent Covenanters,
whom he defeated at Bothwell Bridge. The king's illness, and
the sudden revolution which took place in his councils, upon the
unexpected return of the Duke of York from Flanders, ruined
this project, and occasioned the disgrace of Monmouth, and the
dismissal of Shaftesbury.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Clayton, alderman of London, and one of the representatives
of the city during the two last parliaments of King
Charles II., was warmly attached to the Whig party. He took
an active concern, as a magistrate, in examining the sham-plotter,
Fitz-Harris; and was charged by the Tories with an attempt
to suborn that person to swear, that he had been hired by the
court to fix a plot upon the Protestants. The examination of
Fitz-Harris, who swore, and counter-swore, in many different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
ways, besides avouching that he was bribed to concoct a sham-plot,
and to ascribe it to the Whigs, (a base man&oelig;uvre, too often
played off by both parties to be incredible,) added a thousand improbable
falsehoods about a Papist plot against the Protestants.
When removed from the city jail, and committed to the Tower,
he told another story: He was then in the power of the king, and
alleged, that Howard, and others, were in a plot to seize the king's
person, and that they had employed him to contrive the aforesaid
sham-plot, in order to charge upon the court the crime of subornation,
&amp;c. He added, that Clayton, Bethel, Cornish, and Treby,
the city-recorder, extorted from him, by threats, his previous declaration
concerning the Popish plot, and used the most urgent
means to compel him to impute the guilt of Godfrey's murder to
Danby, and to fix an accession to the Popish conspiracy on the
queen and Duke of York. The man was executed adhering to this
last story. Clayton, and the others accused of such infamous
practices, exculpated themselves in a pamphlet, entitled, "Truth
Vindicated," in which they showed many objections to Fitz-Harris's
final declaration. We must be contented to leave the affair
in mystery; and to regret there ever was a time in England, when
the character and common practices of both the leading parties
in the kingdom were by no means pure enough to exempt either
from such foul suspicions.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Clayton, with the other London members, all of
whom were zealous Whigs, and whose re-election was hailed by
the acclamations of their party,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> attended the Oxford Parliament
in formidable array; they were escorted by a numerous band of
armed partizans, who wore on their hats ribbons, bearing the label,
"No Popery, no Slavery," and were obviously prepared for
something more than an usual attendance upon their duty in the
House of Commons. According to Dugdale's evidence, Sir Robert
Clayton was present at a carousal at Lord Lovelace's, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
Oxford, where Colledge, one of their principal myrmidons, sung
the unlucky ballad, which went so far towards his condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>The story, that Sir Robert Clayton wished to purchase a peerage,
seems to have become popular. In the last will and testament
of the Charter of London is this, among other jocular bequests;
"To Sir Robert Clayton I bequeath all that the chamberlain has
left of the common stock, to purchase Paddington manor, with the
demesnes and appurtenances thereto, since there are now no <em>dukedoms</em>
to be purchased; and it is thought that Tyburn, paying his
arrears next year to the city, will yield a better rate than 20l.
<em>per cent.</em> in the banker's hands."&mdash;<i>Somers' Tracts</i>, p. 185. His
usury is also hinted at in a poem called, "The Duke of Buckingham's
Litany," and its consequences are enumerated among the
other follies of that prodigal peer:</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Player, chamberlain of the city of London, was,
like Sir Robert Clayton, one of the city members, both in the
Westminster and Oxford parliaments; and, being as zealous as his
colleague in the popular cause, what has been said concerning
their mode of marching to Oxford, applies to him as well as to
the other. He is accused of libertinism, in the pasquinade quoted
in the last note, where the Charter of London makes him this bequest:

with Mrs Cresswells<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> for his immediate inheritance, to enjoy

<p>When the Duke of York unexpectedly returned from Brussels,
on the news of the king's illness, his arrival spread discomfiture
through Shaftesbury's party in court, and rage and alarm among
those in the city. Sir Thomas Player, at the head of a numerous
body of citizens, or persons who called themselves so, made his
appearance before the lord-mayor, and court of aldermen; and
after having expatiated, in a set speech, upon the horrors of Popery,
and upon the return of the Duke of York, whose religion
had first led to the conspiracy, and whose recent arrival must necessarily
give it new life, he gravely demanded, that the city-guards
should be doubled, and that four companies, instead of two, should
be appointed to duty every night. The lord-mayor, after some
discussion, evaded Sir Thomas's request, by referring it to the
livery. In the vehemence of the chamberlain's oratory, a remarkable
expression, noticed in the text, chanced to escape him,
"that he durst hardly go to sleep, for fear of awaking with his
throat cut." In the pretended account of this interview, he is
only made to say, that it was now out of doubt, that the Papists
had burnt the city; "And if they had not been disappointed,
would have cut our throats too at the same time, while we were
endeavouring to save the small remainder of our goods." But the
publisher acknowledges, he could give but an imperfect account of
the "speech of this worthy and deserving knight, and the Lord
Mayor's generous reply thereunto." "Cutting throats," indeed,
appears to have been a frequent terror of the zealous knight. In the
Westminster parliament, he made a speech on the Exclusion Bill,
in which, after stating that he had read in Scripture of one man dying
for a nation, but never of three nations dying for one man; he
assured the House, that they "would be embroiled in blood before
they were aware of it;" that he had "<i>no patience to think of sitting
still while his throat was a cutting</i>;" and therefore prayed, they
would endeavour to have laws that might enable them to defend
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> In the parliament of Oxford, Sir Thomas Player
made a violent speech, upon Fitzharris being withdrawn from the
city jail, and sent to the Tower, with a view, as he contended,
of stifling his evidence against the Duke of York and the Papists;
and concluded by making a motion, which was carried, that if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
judge, justice, or jury, should proceed upon him, and he be found
guilty, they be declared guilty of his murder, and betrayers of the
rights of the commons of England. In short, Sir Thomas Player
was a hot-headed violent factionary; but Rouse, one of his dependants
who suffered for the Rye-house plot, with his dying breath
cleared Sir Thomas of any accession to that conspiracy; and declared,
that he broke with Lord Shaftesbury, upon perceiving the
violent plans which he agitated after his being freed from the
Tower. <i>State Trials</i>, p. 750.</p>

<p>Under the name of Judas, Dryden describes the famous Robert
Ferguson, a native of Scotland, and, by profession, an independant
preacher, and teacher of an academy at Islington.&mdash;<cite>Ath. Ox.</cite>
Vol. II. p. 743. He was one of those dark, intriguing, subtile, and
ferocious characters, that emerge into notice in times of turmoil
and civil dissension, and whose appearance as certainly bodes
revolution, as the gambols of the porpoise announce a tempest.
Through the whole of his busy and desperate career, he appears
to have been guided less by any principle, moral or political,
than by the mere pleasure of dealing in matters deep and dangerous,
and exerting his ingenuity to shake the quiet of the kingdom
at the risk of his own neck. In organizing dark and bloody intrigues;
in maintaining the courage of the zealots whom he engaged
in them; in carrying on the mystic correspondence by which the different
parts of the conspiracy were to be cemented and conjoined;
in guarding against the risque of discovery, and, lastly, in effecting
with nicety a hairbreadth escape when it had taken place,&mdash;all
these perilous, dubious, and criminal man&oelig;uvres, at which the noble-minded
revolt, and the peaceful are terrified, were the scenes in
which the genius of Ferguson delighted to exert itself. When the
magistracy of London was thrown into the hands of the crown,
the charter annulled, and all means of accomplishing a revolution
by the ancient existing authorities, were annihilated, such
a character as Ferguson became of inestimable value to Shaftesbury,
considering the new plans which he had in agitation, and
the persons by whom they were to be accomplished. Accordingly,
he shared much of that politician's confidence, while his influence,
as a popular and violent preacher in the city, gave him
every facility of selecting and training the persons fittest to assist
in the meditated insurrection. His chapel, in Moorfields, was
crowded with multitudes of fanatics, whom fired by his political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
sermons, and occasionally stimulated by libels and pamphlets,
from a private press of which he had the management, as well as
of a purse that maintained it. He distributed most of the pamphlets
written on the Whig party, and was by no means averse to father
even the most dangerous of them; his vanity, according to Burnet,
getting the better of his prudence. Some notable pieces, however,
of his composition, are still known; his style was of that diffuse,
coarse, and periphrastic nature, best suited to the apprehension
of the vulgar, upon whose dull intellects sentiments are always
impressive, in proportion to the length of time they are forced
to dwell on them. He wrote the "Appeal from the Country
to the City," where, in plain words, he points out the
Duke of Monmouth as successor to the crown, and that because
he had a dubious, or rather no title at all to claim it. "No
person is fitter than his Grace the Duke of Monmouth, as well
for quality, courage, and conduct, as for that his life and fortune
stand on the same bottom with yours. He will stand by you, and
therefore you ought to stand by him. And remember the old rule
is, <em>He, that has the worst title, ever makes the best king</em>; as being
constrained, by a gracious government, to supply what he wants
in title; that, instead of <em>God and my right</em>, his motto may be,
<em>God and my people</em>." He proceeds to quote a historical example
for putting Monmouth on the throne, under the tutelage of
Shaftesbury, by stating that, after the death of Alexander, nothing
would pacify the dissensions which ensued, "but the
choosing of King Philip's illegitimate son, Aridæus, who, notwithstanding
that he was a man but of reasonable parts himself,
might, as they thought, perform the office well enough, by the help
of his wise protector Perdiceas." This extraordinary piece is filled
with the most violent declamations against the Papists, in that tawdry,
bombastic, and inflammatory eloquence, wherewith, to speak
according to Dryden's parable, he "tempted Jerusalem to sin."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferguson also wrote the second part of "No Protestant Plot,"
another very violent pamphlet, and several treatises on the same
subject. Meanwhile, other means were prepared to effect the
desired change of government. It is not necessary to enter particularly
into the well-known history of the Rye-house plot. Every
body knows, that, while Russel, Sidney, Monmouth, and others,
undertook to raise an insurrection in the country, Shaftesbury
promised to head ten thousand brisk boys in the city of London.
Among these brisk boys were a fanatic party, who agitated projects
of assassinating the King and the Duke of York, unknown
to the more generous nobles, who proposed only to secure the
king's person. In all and each of these cabals, Ferguson acted
a distinguished part. When Shaftesbury fled from his house into
lurking places about Wapping, he trusted Ferguson with the secret
of his residence, although concealed from the noble-minded Russel,
and the generous Monmouth. By his intervention, he heartened
and encouraged the associates to break forth into open insurrection.
With the inferior conspirators, Ferguson was yet more intimate,
and seems, in fact, to have given life to the vague and desperate
plans of <i>lopping</i>, as they called the assassination of the
royal brothers, by the countenance which he pretended to procure
the conspirators from those of superior rank. He told West, he would
procure the Duke of Monmouth's written consent to his father's
murder; although he afterwards allowed, he durst not even mention
such a plan to him. At length, when Shaftesbury, weary of
the delays of the other conspirators, left England for ever, Ferguson
and Walcot were the companions of his flight. By this the
plan of insurrection was for a time confounded, for the higher order
of the malcontents were ignorant of the lines of communication by
which the city cabal was conducted. Ferguson was therefore recalled,
and in an evil hour returned from Holland. His arrival gave
new life both to the upper and inferior conspiracy: in the former,
six of the leaders formed themselves into a regular committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
to extend their influence and correspondence through the kingdom,
and unite measures with the disaffected in Scotland. The
lower band of assassins matured and prepared their plan for assassinating
the king and duke as they returned from Newmarket.
Ferguson, who still acted in the capacity of treasurer, which
Dryden has assigned him, paid for the arms provided for the enterprize;
and, by his daring language, encouraged them to proceed.
He offered, in mockery, to consecrate the blunderbuss
with which Rumbold was to fire into the carriage; and when Sunday
was fixed for the day of action, he quoted the old Scottish
proverb, "the better day, the better deed." Even when, by the
treachery of Keeling, the plot was finally discovered, and the
conspirators were dispersing in dismay and terror, Ferguson took
his leave of them with great gaiety, and, trusting to the plots of
Argyle and Jerviswood, with which he was also intimate, told
them, he hoped to meet them all at Dunbar. This indifference,
at such a crisis, led to a supposition, that he had some secret correspondence
with government: it was even said, that the messenger
who arrested Ferguson suffered him to escape, but of this there
seems no evidence. He retired to Holland, where he joined the
unfortunate Monmouth, and was a principal agent in pushing him
on to his western invasion, when, if left to himself, he would
have remained in quiet. He drew the proclamation which Monmouth
issued at his landing, a prolix, ill-worded production, stuffed
with all the true, and all the false accusations against James II.,
and where the last so much drowned the others, that it was only
calculated to make an impression on the lowest vulgar. He was
always earnest with Monmouth, to take upon himself the title of
king; and may be said to have contributed greatly to every false
step which he made, and to the final destruction in which they
ended. Of this Monmouth was so sensible, that he told the king
in their last interview, "That Ferguson was chiefly the person
who instigated him to set up his title of king, and had been a main
adviser and contriver of the whole affair, as well to the attempting,
as acting, what had been done;" but he had little to answer
when Halifax expressed his surprise, that he should have given
ear to him who, as he had long before told the late king, "was
a bloody rogue, and always advised to the cutting of throats."
Ferguson was taken, on this occasion, the third day after the battle
of Sedgemore. Yet, when so much blood was spilt, both with,
and without the forms of law, this man, who had been most
active in the conspiracy against the king, when Duke of York,
and had now organized an invasion and insurrection in his dominions,
was, by the inexorable James, freely pardoned and dismissed,
to council and assist the next conspiracy. Perhaps his
life was saved by Sunderland, lest he had disclosed what he probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
knew of his intercourse with the Prince of Orange, and even
with Monmouth himself. Ferguson seems, on his liberation, to
have returned to Holland; and did not fail to take a share in
the intrigues which preceded the Revolution. He managed the
dissenters for the interest of the Prince of Orange; and endeavoured
to press upon William a sense of their importance. But other, and
more important engines, were now at work; and Ferguson seems to
have enjoyed but a subaltern consideration: Burnet, who made such
a figure in the expedition, avers, he did not even know him by
sight.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> When the Prince of Orange was at Exeter, the dissenters
refused him the keys of their meeting house. But Ferguson was accustomed
to surmount greater obstacles. "I will take," said he,
laughing, "the kingdom of heaven by storm," and broke open the
door with his own hand. After the Revolution was accomplished,
one would have thought Ferguson's machinations might have
ended. He had seen his party triumphant; he had been rewarded
with a good post;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> and, what was probably dearer to him
than either principle or profit, his intrigues had successfully contributed
to the achievement of a great change of government. But
it was not in his nature to be in repose; and, having spent all the
former part of his life in caballing to drive James from the throne,
he now engaged with the same fervour in every conspiracy for his
restoration. In the very year which succeeded that of the Revolution,
we find him deeply engaged with Sir James Montgomery,
and the other Scottish presbyterians, who, discontented with King
William, had united with the Jacobites. The Marquis of Anandale
having absconded on account of his share in this conspiracy,
Ferguson secreted him for several weeks; a kindness which the
Marquis repaid, by betraying him to government.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> With his usual
good fortune, he was dismissed; either in consideration of former
services, or because a full proof against him was not to be obtained.
After this, he continued to engage in every plot against the
government; and each year published one or two pamphlets,
which put his ears, if not his neck, in peril. His last grand exhibition
was an attack upon Trenchard, the secretary of state,
for the use of blank and general warrants.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> But that adventure,
as the romance writers say, was reserved for another demagogue.
Finally, Ferguson, who had in this remarkable manner kept his
promise of being engaged in every conspiracy of his time, and, had
gained the honourable epithet of "The Plotter," died quietly, and
in peace, after having repeatedly seen the scaffold stream with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
blood of the associates of his various machinations. One touch
alone softens the character of this extraordinary incendiary. In
all his difficulties, he is never charged with betraying his associates.
His person is thus remarkably described in the proclamation for
apprehending his person, among the other Rye-house assassins.</p>

<p>Of James Forbes I can give but a slight account. He was
placed by the Duke of Ormond as travelling tutor to the young
Earl of Derby, who had married his grand-daughter. Carte says,
he was a gentleman of parts, virtue, and prudence, but of too mild
a nature to manage his pupil. In Paris the earl addicted himself
to the society of one Merrit, a worthless profligate; and the governor
having cautioned his charge against this acquaintance, was assaulted
at disadvantage by Merrit, and dangerously wounded.
Lord Derby, it seems, not only countenanced Merrit's assault upon
Mr Forbes, but, at the instigation of some young French rakes, consented
to his governor's being tossed in a blanket. The Duke of Ormond,
finding that the earl was wild and impatient of restraint, and
that his tutor's sage remonstrances had but little effect, recalled Forbes,
and sent in his stead Colonel Thomas Fairfax, a gallant and
brave man, and roughly honest. Lord Derby was at first restiff; but
Fairfax telling him plainly, that he was sent to govern him, and
would govern him, and that his lordship must submit, and should
do it, the young nobleman had the sense to comply, broke off his
evil acquaintances, and behaved ever after with great propriety.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
Forbes's misadventures in Paris, though, according to Carte, they
inferred no real dishonour, are severely alluded to by Dryden in
the text. I am not anxious to unrip the ancient chronicle of
scandal, in order to trace Phaleg's amours. He appears to have
become one of Monmouth's dependants.</p>

<p>The Reverend Samuel Johnson, a party-writer of considerable
merit. He was a native of Warwickshire, and took orders after
a regular course of study at Cambridge. He obtained the small
living of Curingham, in Essex, by the patronage of a Mr Biddolph.
The emoluments of this benefice did not exceed eighty pounds
a-year; and it was the only church preferment he ever enjoyed.
Dryden alludes to his poverty in describing his original situation.
Mr Johnson's patron, observing his turn for politics, exhorted
him to study the English constitution in Bracton and Fortescue;
but by no means to make his sermons the vehicle for his
political sentiments. The opinions which he formed in the course
of study, were such as recommended him as chaplain to the famous
Lord Russell.</p>

<p>While he was in this situation, and during the dependance of
the Bill of Exclusion, he endeavoured at once to show the danger
to a national religion from a sovereign who held opposite tenets,
and to explode the doctrine of passive obedience, in a work entitled,
"Julian the Apostate; with a short Account of his Life,
and a Parallel betwixt Popery and Paganism." In this performance,
according to Wood, he was assisted by Thomas Hunt the
lawyer. This book, which made a good deal of noise at the time,
was answered by the learned Hickes, in a treatise called "Jovian,"
in which, according to Anthony a Wood, the doctor hath, with
unquestionable clearness, laid open the folly, "ignorance, weakness,
and pernicious drift of that traitorous scribbler." Without
entering into the controversy, there can be little doubt, that, so far
as the argument from the example of the primitive Christians is
sound, Johnson has fairly made out his case. Indeed Dryden has
little left to say, except, that if they did resist Julian, which he
seems to admit, they were very wrong in so doing, and the less
that is said about it, the more will be the credit of the ancient
church. Johnson prepared a reply to "Jovian," called, the "Arts
of Julian to undermine Christianity;" but the Rye-house Plot
having intervened, he did not judge it prudent to publish it. He
was called before the Privy Council, who insisted upon knowing
why this book, which had been entered at Stationers Hall, was not
published? His answer alleged, that the ferment of the nation was so
great as to render the further discussion of the question imprudent.
They then demanded a copy of the book; and added, that, if they
approved it, it should be published. To this insidious proposal
he boldly replied, that, having suppressed the book, it only contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
his private thoughts, which he could be compelled to disclose
to no man on earth. For this answer he was committed to
prison, and his house searched for the copies, which had fortunately
been bestowed elsewhere. The court finding themselves unable
to reach Johnson for <em>not</em> publishing his second work, determined
to try him for publishing his first. Accordingly, he was brought to
the bar and insulted by Jefferies, who told him, he would give him a
text, "Let every man study to be quiet, and mind his own business."&mdash;"I
minded my business as an Englishman," answered this
spirited man, "when I wrote that book." All defence was in
vain; he was condemned to a heavy fine, and to lie in jail till it
was paid, which in his circumstances was equal to a sentence of perpetual
imprisonment. Even from his prison house, where he lay for
five years, amid the accumulated distresses of sickness and poverty,
he let his countrymen hear his voice, and failed not to enter an
animated and vigorous protest against each new encroachment
upon the liberty and religion of England.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> At length, having
published "An humble and hearty Address to all the English Protestants
in this present Army,"<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> exhorting them not to serve as
instruments to eradicate their religion and enslave their country,
he again fell under the grasp of power, was tried and sentenced to
be thrice pilloried, and whipped from Newgate to Tyburn; having
been previously degraded from his ecclesiastical orders. He bore
both the previous ceremony of degradation, and the cruel punishment
which followed, with the greatest magnanimity. When they
disrobed him, he told the divines present, that he could not but
grieve, since all he had written was to keep the gowns on their
backs, they should nevertheless be the unhappy instruments to
pull off his. When they put a Bible into his hand as a part of
the formality of degradation, and again took it from him, he was
much affected, and said with tears, they could not, however, deprive
him of the use and benefit of that sacred deposit.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> On the
1st of December, 1686, he suffered the remainder of his inhuman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
sentence; the pain being his, but the infamy that of the persons
who imposed it.</p>

<p>After the Revolution, the proceedings against this staunch patriot
were declared illegal; and he received a pension of L.300 yearly,
with L.1000 in money, and a post for his son. Crewe, Bishop of
Durham, who acted as one of the commissioners for discharging
the duty of the Bishop of London, and as such was active in Mr
Johnson's degradation, compounded with him against a suit at
law, by payment of a handsome sum. Yet Johnson's dangers
were not over; for, such was the enmity of the adherents of King
James against him, that a party of desperate assassins broke into
his house by night, beat, wounded, and threatened to pistol him,
for the books he had written; but, upon his wife's intreaties, at
length desisted from their bloody design. The latter part of his
days were spent in quietness and independence.</p>

<p>The reader may contrast the character which Dryden has given
of Johnson, with that of Hampden, who, in an account of him to
the Duchess of Mazarine, says; "Being two years with him in
the same prison, I had the opportunity to know him perfectly
well; and, to speak my thoughts of him in one word, I can assure
your Grace, that I never knew a man of better sense, of a more
innocent life, nor of greater virtue, which was proof against all
temptation, than Mr Johnson."&mdash;See Memorials of his Life prefixed
to his Works in folio.</p>

<p>The famous Gilbert Burnet was then lecturer at St Clements,
and preacher at the Rolls chapel, under the patronage of Sir Harbottle
Grimstone, Master of the Rolls. King Charles was so anxious
that he should be dismissed, as to make it his particular request
to Sir Harbottle; but the Master excused himself. It was
here he preached that famous sermon on the day of the Gunpowder
Treason, 5th November, 1684, when he chose for his
text, "Save me from the <i>lion's</i> mouth, thou hast heard me from
the horns of the <i>unicorns</i>;" which, in spite of the doctor's protestations
to the contrary, certain suspicious persons considered as
an allusion to the supporters of the king's arms. For this he was
finally disgraced, and turned out of the chapel of the Rolls. See
note on the Buzzard, in the "Hind and Panther."</p>

<p>Samuel Pordage, a minor poet and dramatist of the time, drew
this passing sarcasm on his person and pedigree, by a stupid poem,
called "Azariah and Hushai," published 1681-2; being an attempt
to imitate or answer "Absalom and Achitophel:" with
what success the reader may judge, from the following character
of Dryden:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Shimei, the poet laureat of that age,</div>
  <div class="i0">The falling glory of the Jewish stage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who scourged the priest, and ridiculed the plot,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like common men, must not be quite forgot.</div>
  <div class="i0">Sweet was the muse that did his wit inspire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had he not let his hackney muse to hire:</div>
  <div class="i0">But variously his knowing muse could sing,</div>
  <div class="i0">Could Doeg praise, and could blaspheme the king;</div>
  <div class="i0">The bad make good, good bad, and bad make worse.</div>
  <div class="i0">Bless in heroics, and in satires curse.</div>
  <div class="i0">Shimei to Zabed's<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> praise could tune his muse,</div>
  <div class="i0">And princely Azaria could abuse.</div>
  <div class="i0">Zimri, we know, he had no cause to praise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Because he dubbed him with the name of Bayes:</div>
  <div class="i0">Revenge on him did bitter venom shed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Because he tore the laurel from his head;</div>
  <div class="i0">Because he durst with his proud wit engage,</div>
  <div class="i0">And brought his follies on the public stage.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tell me, Apollo, for I can't divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Why wives he cursed, and praised the concubine;</div>
  <div class="i0">Unless it were, that he had led his life</div>
  <div class="i0">With a teeming matron, ere she was a wife;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or that it best with his dear muse did suit,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who was for hire a very prostitute.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He also stepped forward to break a lance with our author, on
the subject of Shaftesbury's acquittal; and answered the "Medal"
by a very stupid poem, called the "Medal Reversed." To all
this scurrilous doggrel, Dryden only replied by the single couplet
above quoted. He calls Mephibosheth "the wizard's son," because
the Reverend John Pordage, vicar of Bradfield, in Berkshire, and
father of the poet, Samuel, was ejected from his cure by the commissioners
of Berkshire, for conversation with evil spirits, and for
blasphemy, ignorance, scandalous behaviour, devilism, uncleanness,
and heaven knows what. His case of insufficiency is among
the State Trials, from which he seems to have been a crazy enthusiast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
who believed in a correspondence with genii and dæmons.</p>

<p>Samuel Pordage was a member of the society of Lincoln's Inn.
He wrote three plays, namely, the "Troades," translated from
Seneca, "Herod and Mariamne," and "The Siege of Babylon."
He also published a romance called "Eliana," and prepared a
new edition of "God's Revenge against Murder," which was published
after his death. Pordage was, moreover, author of "Heroic
Stanzas on his Majesty's Coronation, 1661," and probably of other
occasional pieces, deservedly doomed to oblivion.</p>

<p>Jack Hall, ranked as a sort of third-rate poet and courtier

Whether we suppose Sidley, or Sidney, to be represented under

it is possible that Jack Hall went into opposition with his friend
and admirer. See the note upon Hall, appended to the "Essay

<p>Elkanah Settle, whose original quarrel with our author is detailed
in the introductory remarks to their prose controversy, had
now further incensed him, by tergiversation in politics: For Elkanah,
although originally a Tory, was induced, probably by his
connections as poet-laureat for the city, to go over to the party
of Monmouth and Shaftesbury.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> His new friends made use of
his talents in a two-fold capacity. Shaftesbury employed him to
write a pamphlet in favour of the Exclusion, entitled, "The Character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
of a Popish Successor." When Settle afterwards recanted,
he said, this piece, which made some noise at the time, was retouched
by "his noble friend in Aldersgate Street," whose only
objection was, that it was not sufficiently violent in favour of insurrection.
Settle, having a mechanical turn, was also employed
as chief engineer at the solemn pope-burning, which we have so
often mentioned; in which charge he acquitted himself much to
the satisfaction of his employers. On account of his literary and
mechanical merits, Sir Roger L'Estrange allots him the double office
of poet-laureat and master of the ordnance to the Whig faction,
in the following passage of a dialogue between Jest and Earnest:</p>

<p>"<em>Jest.</em> For instance, I knew a lusty fellow, who would not willingly
be thought valiant,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> who has an indifferent hand at making
of crackers, serpents, rockets, and the other playthings that are
proper on the 5th of November; and has for such his skill received
applause, and victuals, from the munificent gentlemen about
Temple-bar.</p>

<p>"<em>Earnest.</em> And he, I'll warrant, is made master of the ordnance?</p>

<p>"<i>Jest.</i> True; and I think him very fit for it. But he's like to
have another employment, of a strangely different nature; for, because
this dull wretch, once upon a time, wrote a fulsomely nonsensical
poem, in prose, being a character of a bugbear, he, forsooth,
is designed poet-laureat too!</p>

<p>"<em>Earnest.</em> These two offices, as you say, one would think,
should require diverse accomplishments: But then it may be said,
that these may well enough be supplied by one man; the poet to
make ballads in peace, and betake himself to his other business in
war.</p>

<p>"<em>Jest.</em> Nay, his squibs and his poems have much what the
same fortune; they crack and bounce, and the boys and girls
laugh at them.</p>

<p>"<em>Earnest.</em> Well, how great are the advantages! I thought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
author of the satyric work upon the "Observator," and Heraclitus,
or the <em>Person of Honour</em>, that obliged the pie-folks with poetical
reflections upon "Absalom and Achitophel;" I say, I thought
these forsaken scribblers might have bid fairest for the evergreen
twig.</p>

<p>"<em>Jest.</em> I thought so too; but hunger will break stone-walls.
Elk. promises to vindicate Lucifer's first rebellion for a few guineas.
Poor Absalom and Achitophel must e'en hide themselves
in the Old Testament again; and I question whether they'll be
safe there from the fury of this mighty Cacadoggin.</p>

<p>"<em>Earnest.</em> Silly chit! has he not learned the apologue of the
Serpent and the File? But fare him well."&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Heraclitus Redens</i>,
No. 50.</p>

<p>From the last part of this passage, it appears that Settle was
then labouring upon his answer to "Absalom and Achitophel,"
for which Dryden condemned him to a disgraceful immortality.
At length he came forth with "Absalom Senior, or Achitophel
Transprosed."<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>In this piece Dryden's plan is followed, by applying the names
and history of scripture to modern persons and events. Thus,
Queen Elizabeth is Deborah, and Sir Francis Drake, Barak; the
Papists are the worshippers of Baal, and the Duke of York is Absalom.
This circumstance did not escape the wit of Dryden, who
says of Settle, in the text,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">For almonds he'll cry whore to his own mother,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or call young Absalom King David's brother.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Indeed, Elkanah seems himself to have been sensible of the absurdity
of this personification, by which the king's brother, almost
as old as himself, was converted into the blooming son of David;
and apologizes, in his preface addressed to the Tories, for "the
freedom of clapping but about a score of years extraordinary on
the back of Absalom. Neither is it," he continues, "altogether
so unpardonable a poetical licence; since we find as great slips
from the author of your own 'Absalom,' where we see him bring
in a Zimri into the court of David, who, in the scripture story,
died by the hand of Phineas, in the days of Moses.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Nay, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>other extreme, we find him, in another place, talking of the martyrdom
of Stephen, so many ages after; and, if so famous an author
can forget his own rules of unity, time, and place, I hope
you'll give a minor poet some grains of allowance."</p>

rape being explained the discovery of the plot:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>As Settle's poems have long fallen into total oblivion, from
which his name has only been rescued by the satirical pen of Dryden,
and as he was once thought no unequal rival for that great
poet, the reader may be curious to see a specimen of his style; I
have therefore inserted the few of the leading characters of "Absalom
Senior," in which he has "rhymed and rattled" with most
tolerable success.</p>

<p>But, as was reasonably to be expected, Settle has exerted his
whole powers of satire and poetry in the description of his antagonist
Dryden: And here let me remark, that almost all the adversaries
of our author commence their attack, by an unwilling compliment
to his poetical powers:</p>

<p>Settle's end was utterly inglorious. In 1683, he deserted the
cause of the Whigs, and returned to that of the Tories; for whom
he wrote several periodical tracts, in one of which, entitled, "A
Narrative," he accused his old patron Shaftesbury of correcting
the famous "Character of a Popish Successor;" and objecting,
that it did not speak favourably enough of rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Whether
compelled by poverty, or through zeal for the royal cause, he became
a trooper in King James's army, when it was encamped on
Hounslow-Heath.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Finally, he took the prophetic hint conveyed
in Dryden's lines, and became, not indeed the master, but the
assistant, to a puppet-show, kept by a Mrs Minns, in Bartholomew-fair.
Thus, the expression, which Dryden had chiefly used
in contemptuous allusion to the share which Settle had in directing
the Pope-burning, and the fire-works which accompanied it,
was literally fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Nay, poor Elkanah, in his old age, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>at length obliged not only to write for the puppet-show, but to
appear in it as a performer, inclosed in a case representing a green
dragon of his own proper device. There are few readers, who
need to be reminded of Pope's famous lines,&mdash;</p>

<p>In the close of life, this veteran scribbler found admission to
the Charter-house; and in that hospital, in the year 1724, died
the rival of Dryden.</p>

<p>Our author had very shortly before the publication of the second
part of "Absalom and Achitophel," made his enemy, Shadwell,
the subject of a separate and cutting personal satire, called "Mac
Flecnoe." That poem, as we have noticed in the introductory remarks,
has reference principally to the literary character of his adversary;
while, in the lines which follow, he considers him chiefly
as a political writer, and factionary of the popular party. Shadwell's
corpulence, his coarse and brutal debauchery, his harsh
and clumsy style of poetry, fell under the lash on both occasions;
and it is astonishing, with what a burning variety of colours these
qualities are represented. The history of his literary disputes
with Dryden may be perused in the introduction to "Mac
Flecnoe." In the "Vindication of the Duke of Guise," Dryden
has also given a severe flagellation to his corpulent adversary, in
which he says, "that although Shadwell has often called him an
atheist in print, he believes more charitably of his antagonist, and
that he only goes the broad way, because the other is too narrow
for him."</p>

<p>Besides avenging abundance of personal abuse, Dryden, in the
person of Shadwell, chastises a great supporter of the Whig cause
and principles. Shadwell himself complains, that, in the days of
Charles and James, he "was silenced for a non-conformist poet."
He was the chief among the "corrector-men," as the authors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
publishers of the Whig party were oddly entitled;<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> and received
the reward of his principles at the Revolution, succeeding, as is well
known, our author in the office of poet laureat. In the epilogue
to the "Volunteers," a play of Shadwell's, acted after his
death, the friends of the Revolution are called upon to applaud
their favourite bard's last production:</p>

<p>The reader will find some account of the King's Head Club,
Vol. VII. p. 154. North gives the following lively account of
the <em>vulgar</em>, as he calls them, of the popular faction. Their employ,
according to him, was, "to run about whispering here and
there, by which management they kept up the spirits of their fools,
whose fire, without a continual <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pabulum</i> of fresh news, talks, and
hopes, would go out. Amongst these, the cues and hints went
about; honest, drunken, lying fellows, good company, and always
dear friends. A nod, with a wink, had a notable signification,
if it followed, 'Have patience, you shall see.'&mdash;'I know somewhat
extraordinary will be done shortly and soon, which will secure
all on our side.' And thus passively wicked were these underlings,
or fry of the party: they knew of the intrigue no more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
and were concerned as the wood of drums and the brass of trumpets
are in the war."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>&mdash;"The pastime of this meeting, called the
Club, was very engaging to young gentlemen, and one, who had
once tasted the conversation, could scarcely ever quit it. For some
or others were continually coming and going, to import or export
news or stories, as the trade required and afforded. There it was
known in half an hour, what any member said at the committee
of elections, or in the house, if it sat late. And every post carried
the news and tales legitimated there, as also the malign constructions
of all the good actions of the government, especially to places
where elections were depending to shape men's characters into fit
qualifications to be chosen or rejected. The Pope himself could
not make saints so readily as they Papists, and so half-three-quarter
Papists, as belief was prompt or difficult. And a lewd atheistical
fellow was as readily washed clean, and made a zealous Protestant.
For that genus of perfection was not wanted in this dispensation,
where no vice, immorality, heresy, atheism, or blasphemous
wit, had not professors ready to embrace willing disciples,
who, for the sake of such sublimities of wit and sense as they
were accounted, were ready to prostitute all principles of duty,
and especially those that regarded allegiance to the crown."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>The well-known distinction of this famous club was a green
ribband: in opposition to which, the Tories wore in their hats a
scarlet ribband, with the motto, <em>Rex et Hæredes</em>. The prologue to
"Anna Bullen" very sensibly expostulates against these party
badges:</p>

<p>Sir William Waller, son of the parliamentary general of the
same name, distinguished himself during the time of the Popish
plot, by an uncommon decree of bustling activity. He was a
justice of peace; and, unawed by the supposed fate of his brother
in the commission, and in knighthood, Sir Edmondbury Godfrey,
he stood forth the bold investigator of this bottomless conspiracy.
It was he who had the fortune, by the assistance of Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Dangerfield, to detect what was called the Meal-Tub Plot,
which that fellow, who had been trafficking with both factions,
and probably meant to cheat both, chose to represent as a sham
conspiracy, contrived to ruin Shaftesbury and his friends. Upon
this occasion, Sir William had much closeting with a magnanimous
midwife, called Mrs Cellier, whom Dangerfield charged as
an agent of the court, and who afterwards alleged, that the knight
took some uncommon means to extort confessions from her.
Sir William Waller was also the person who discovered Fitzharris's
Plot; and he intimated, that the king, who intended to turn it upon
the Protestants, was so much displeased with his blowing up
the project, that he threatened to have him assassinated. The
Tories alleged, that the pleasure of making these discoveries was
not Sir William's sole reward, any more than zeal was his only
motive for gutting the Popish chapels. "In which," says North,
"he proceeded with such scandalous rigour, as to bring forth the
pictures and other furniture of great value, and burn them publicly;
which gave occasion to suspect, and some said positively,
that, under this pretence, he kept good things for himself; in a
word, he was called the priest-catcher."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Anthony Wood joins
in the accusation of his rifling the Papists' houses of goods, and appropriating
chapel ornaments as popish trinkets. I find that respectable
person, Miles Prance, the witness, enters into a solemn vindication
of the justice, from the practices alleged by North, Wood,
and by the poet. "Another damnable scandal they have broached,
which, though it be principally levelled at Sir William Waller, as
if he, under pretence of searching for priests, and seizing popish
trinkets, should take away money, plate, and other things of value
from the owners, and necklaces of pearl for beads; yet, since
I very frequently went along with him, it does obliquely reflect
upon me, and I cannot but do that worthy gentleman the right to
justify him against such a most false, groundless, and malicious
slander: I do therefore declare, in the presence of God, and shall
be ready to attest upon oath, that whensoever I attended him in
searches, which was almost every day, I could never discover in
him the least inclination to any such base practices; but that, to
the contrary, he behaved himself as a good Christian and just magistrate;
for, wherever we came, what money we found was left
in the owner's possession; and as for chalices, and pieces of plate belonging
to priests, and used in their mass, or for keeping of holy
oil, we did indeed batter or break them to pieces, but always returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
all the pieces to the proprietors. But their copes and
priestly vestments, superstitious pictures, habits of monks belonging
to their peculiar orders, and such like trumpery, we did
sometimes take away, and cause them to be publicly burned, never
making any advantage thereof. And as to any necklaces of
pearl, reported to be by him taken away, I am more than confident
the same is as arrand a lie, as that he thought one Bedingfield,
whom he took at Newark, to have been the same Bedingfield,
who died in the Gatehouse; for he well knew it was another
man."<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Prance confirms this attestation by a special case,
in which Sir William returned to a priest, not only his money,
but a silver tobacco-box.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Derrick mentions Sir William standing candidate, in 1679, to
be a member of Parliament, in which he failed; and adds, that the
publicans, who trusted him, found much ado to get their money.
When the court party gained an ascendance, Sir William Waller
was first struck out of the commission, and afterwards committed
to prison, to the great triumph of the Tories.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> He afterwards

<p>The Whigs of those days had constant recourse to the desperate
remedy of refusing supplies, when dissatisfied with the court. This
ultimate measure ought only to be adopted in cases of extremity;
because the want of means to maintain the usual current expences
for the law, and the defence of the country, gives a perilous shock
to the whole system of government. At that time, however, it
was held so effectual a check, and so necessary, that the Whig
citizens, in a paper of instructions furnished to their representatives
in 1680-1, having thanked them for their good service, more especially
for their zeal for the Exclusion Bill, proceed to recommend,
"that they would still literally pursue the same measures,
and grant no supplies to the crown, till they saw themselves effectually
secured from popery and arbitrary power."</p>

<p>In 1678-9, when the plot hung like a comet over England, the
king thought it necessary to assent to the counsel of the Earl of
Danby, and request the Duke of York to give way to the storm,
and silence the popular clamour, by retreating for a season to the
Continent. The Duke requested a particular order, lest it should
be supposed he fled from a consciousness of guilt. The order was
in these words: "I have already given you my resolution at large,
why I think it fit that you absent yourself some time beyond the
seas. As I am truly sorry for the occasion, so you may be sure
I shall never desire it longer than it may be absolutely necessary
for your good and my service. In the meantime, I think proper
to give it you under my hand, that I expect this compliance from
you, and desire it may be as soon as conveniently you can. You
may easily perceive with what trouble I write this to you, there
being nothing I am more sensible of than the kindness you have
ever had for me. I hope you are as just to me, as to be assured,
that no absence, nor any thing else, can ever change me from being
truly and kindly yours, C. R. February 28th 1678-9." Superscribed,
"For my most dear friend the Duke of York."</p>

<p>Authors differ concerning the "store of parting tears," which
were shed on the separation of the royal brothers. Burnet says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
that the duke wept much, but the king did not seem affected.
Others affirm, that both brothers testified much emotion. The
duke retired to Brussels, where he remained till the time of the
king's illness, so often mentioned.</p>

<p>That Charles II. was a pensioner of France, is now generally allowed.
But, though Louis was willing to afford the king of England
such supplies as to save him from the necessity of throwing
himself on his parliament, it was equally his policy to foster such
opposition to him in that assembly, as might totally engage the
eyes of both parties upon domestic feuds, and withdraw them from
marking his own ambitious strides towards universal power. For
this it was necessary, that his minister Barillon should have an understanding
with the leaders of the popular party. Hence each
faction, as truly as loudly, accused the other of the unworthy dependence
on France, to which both were in secret reduced. An
account of the French intrigues with the popular party, and of
the money distributed among their chiefs, may be found in <i>Dalrymple's

<p>In some respects, the presence of the Duke of York in Scotland
was very acceptable to the nobles and gentry of that kingdom.
There is, among Somers' Tracts, a letter from a person of quality in
Scotland, who professes, that, although a zealous Protestant, he
had been converted from his opinion in favour of the Bill of Exclusion,
by "the personal knowledge of his very many excellencies
and virtues." Doubtless, many circumstances drew the Scots to
the faction and favour of the Duke. They saw the halls of their
ancient palace again graced with the appearance of royalty, and occupied
by a descendant of their long line of kings. The formal,
grave, and stately decorum of James, was more suitable to the
manners of a proud, reserved, and somewhat pedantic people, than
the lighter manners of Charles. The proud, as well as the ingenious,
know, and feel, the value of favours conferred by those who resemble
them. York applied himself particularly to secure the personal
attachment of the Highland chiefs, and to staunch the feuds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
by which their clans were divided. He, no doubt, reckoned upon
the assistance of these ready warriors, in case the sword had been
drawn in England; but he little foresaw, that the last hopes of his
family were to depend on the generous attachment of the descendants
of the chieftains whom he then cultivated, and that his
race were to involve in their fall the ruin of the patriarchal and
feudal power of these faithful adherents. But if the conduct of
James in these particulars was laudable, on the other hand, by
introducing an inconsistent and absurd test into the law, by making
it the means of ruining a loyal and innocent nobleman, the
Earl of Argyle, by satiating his own eyes with the tortures inflicted
on the Covenanters,&mdash;he gave tokens of that ill-judged and bigotted
severity, which was the cause of his being precipitated from
the throne. Settle gives a juster, if a less poetical, account of the
manner in which he spent his exile:</p>

<p>Admiral Legge, created Earl of Dartmouth by Charles II., and
a particular friend of the Duke of York. When James came to the
throne, he loaded Dartmouth with favours, and paid a singular
testimony to the family loyalty, celebrated in the text. In 1687,
while the earl attended the king on his progress, the city of
Coventry presented his majesty with a massive gold cup, which he
instantly delivered to Lord Dartmouth, telling him, it was an acknowledgement
from the city for the sufferings of his father, who
had long lain in jail there, on account of his adherence to the king
during the civil wars. In the succeeding year, Dartmouth was
made admiral of the fleet of England. He was, perhaps, the worthiest
man, and most faithful servant, in the court of King James,
whom he truly loved and served, though he disapproved of his arbitrary
encroachments, and spoke his mind on the subject without
fear or scruple. Although a hereditary enemy of Lord Russell,
Dartmouth had the generosity to interfere in his favour. He set
sail from Torbay, with the English fleet, to intercept that of the
Prince of Orange, at the time of the Revolution. Had they met,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
a bloody action must have been the consequence; but God ordered
it otherwise. The same wind, which carried the Dutch fleet
into Torbay, forced back the English to the Downs; and before
Dartmouth could again put to sea, the officers and sailors were as
unwilling to resist the Prince of Orange, as the nobles and land
army. When Lord Dartmouth found it was entirely out of his
power to serve King James, he called a council of war, and joined
in an address to King William. In 1691-2, he was committed to
the Tower, on suspicion of holding correspondence with his old
master.</p>

<p>General Edward Sackville, a gentleman of good quality, related
to the Dorset family, who had served at Tangier with great reputation,
both for courage and judgment. Being a particular friend
of the Duke of York, he expressed himself very contemptuously
concerning the Popish conspiracy, saying, "they were sons of
whores who believed there was a plot, and he was a lying rogue
that said it." The Commons, being then in the very height of their
fermentation on this subject, not only expelled Sackville from the
House, but prepared an address to the king, that he might be made
incapable of holding any office. He was committed to the Tower,
but shortly afterwards set free, and restored to his military rank,
though not to his seat in the House. After noticing Dartmouth,
Sackville, and the other real friends of the Duke of York, the
poet stigmatizes those concealed enemies, who now affected to
congratulate his return:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>A marginal note on Luttrell's copy points out the Earl of Anglesea
as particularly concerned in this sarcasm. In a prologue,
spoken before the duke at his first appearance at the theatre after
his return, Dryden is equally severe on these time-serving courtiers:</p>

<p>The Duke of York maintained some interest in the city, by being
captain-general of the Artillery Company, who invited him to
dine at Merchant-Taylors' Hall, on April 21, 1682. The party of
Monmouth and Shaftesbury resolved to have a meeting in opposition
to that which was proposed; and tickets, at a guinea a piece,
of which the following is a copy, were circulated among their adherents:</p>

<p>"It having pleased Almighty God, by his wonderful providence,
to deliver and protect his majesties person, the Protestant
religion, and English liberties, hitherto from the hellish and frequent
attempts of their enemies the Papists; in testimony of thankfulness
herein, and for the preserving and improving mutual love
and charity among such as are sensible thereof, you are desired to
meet many of the loyal Protestant nobility, gentry, clergy, and
citizens, on Friday the 21st day of this instant April, 1682, at ten
of the clock, at St Michael's Church, in Cornhill, there to hear a
sermon, and from thence to go to Haberdashers' Hall, to dinner,
and to bring this ticket with you."</p>

<p>A sermon was accordingly prepared for this great occasion;<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
and doubtless contained what is vulgarly called a touch of the
times. All other preparations for this great entertainment were
made with proper magnificence; but the design was utterly quashed
by the following proclamation:</p>

<p>"Whitehall, April 19. His Majesty was pleased, this afternoon,
to make the following order in council, at the court of Whitehall,
this 19th day of April, 1682. By his Majesty, and the Lords of
his Majesty's most honourable privy council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whereas, the appointing of publique fasts and thanksgiving is
matter of state, and belongs only to his majesty, by his prerogative,
and his majesty being informed that, in the city of London,
invitations have been made of great and unusual numbers, by
printed tickets, one of which is hereunto annext; his majesty looks
upon the same as an insolent attempt, in manifest derogation of
his right, and of dangerous consequence: The matter of the said
invitation being of a publique nature, and the manner of carrying
it on, tending to sedition, and raising distinctions and confederacies
among his subjects, against the known laws and peace of the kingdom,
his majesty, therefore, by the advice of his council, hath
thought fit, and doth hereby strictly charge and command the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, as they will answer the
contrary at their peril, to take immediate and effectual care to
prevent and hinder the said meeting, as an unlawful assembly;
and all sheriffs, constables, and others his majesty's officers in the
said city, are hereby commanded to be aiding and assisting therein."</p>

<p>This disappointment, trifling as it may seem, was of great disadvantage
to the Whigs. It made them ridiculous; which is more
fatal to a political party than any other misfortune; for few
chuse to belong to the faction who have the laugh against them.
The Tory poets exulted in the opportunity of showing their wit;
and we have perpetual allusions to this ludicrous incident, in the
fugitive pieces of the time. Thus, Otway, in the prologue to the
"City Heiress, or Sir Timothy Treatall:"</p>

<p>The Marquis of Worcester, Lord President of Wales, was a keen
opponent of the Bill of Exclusion; insomuch, that, by a vote of the
Commons in 1680, he was declared a favourer of Popery, (then an
imputation of tremendous import,) and an address was appointed
to be preferred against him, Halifax, Clarendon, and others, as
enemies to the king and kingdom. It may be supposed, that this
was far from lowering the marquis in the king's esteem; on the
contrary, in 1682, he was created Duke of Beaufort. At the
Duke of Monmouth's invasion he commanded in Bristol, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
an effectual means of stopping his progress; for, when he approached
that city, which contained many of his partisans, the
Duke of Beaufort, finding there was great danger of an insurrection
in the place, declared, that he would burn the town the instant
he saw the slightest symptoms of disloyalty. When this was
made known to Monmouth, he exclaimed, "God forbid I should
be the means of exposing so noble a city to the double calamity
of sword and fire!" Accordingly, he instantly altered the direction
of his march, leaving behind him that rich and populous city,
which, if he could have carried it, contained men to increase his
forces, stores to supply them, arms to equip them, and money to
pay them. This proved a fatal indulgence of compassion:</p>

</div>

<p>The Duke of Beaufort continued to be a friend to James, after,
by abdicating his throne, he had ceased to be a friend to himself.
He voted against William in the Convention Parliament. Lord
Herbert, of Ragland, the duke's eldest son, in whom he "saw all
his glories copied," as the poet has it, was, according to Wood,
entered at Christ Church, Oxford, and took the degree of Master
of Arts in 1681.</p>

<p>An account of the Duke of Beaufort's noble house-keeping, and
mode of educating his family, has been preserved by Roger North,
and presents so curious a picture of the interior of a great family,
in the end of the 17th century, that I think the reader will
be pleased to see it:</p>

<p>"One year his lordship, (the Lord Chief Justice North, afterwards
Lord Keeper Guilford,) concluding at Bristol, made a visit
at Badminton to the Duke of Beaufort, and staid about a week.
For the duke was descended from a North of his lordship's family,
viz. one of the Lord Edward North's daughters, whom a lineal
ancestor of his Grace married. So, besides conformity of principle,
with respect to the public, they were, by this relation, qualified
for mutual respect and honour. I mention this entertainment
as an handle of shewing a princely way of living, which that
noble duke used, above any other, except crowned heads, that I
have had notice of in Europe; and, in some respects, greater than
most of them, to whom he might have been an example. He had
above L. 2000 per annum in his hands, which he managed by
stewards, bailiffs, and servants; and, of that, a great part of the
country, which was his own, lying round about him, was part,
and the husbandmen, &amp;c. were of his family, and provided for in
his large expanded house. He bred all his horses, which came
to the husbandry first colts, and, from thence, as they were fit,
were taken into his equipage; and, as by age, or accident, they
grew unfit for that service, they were returned to the place from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
whence they came, and there expired; except what, for plenty or
unfitness, were sold or disposed of. He had about two hundred
persons in his family, all provided for, and, in his capital house,
nine original tables covered every day: and, for the accommodation
of so many, a large hall was built, with a sort of alcove at
one end, for distinction; but yet the whole lay in the view of him
that was chief, who had power to do what was proper for keeping
order amongst them; and it was his charge to see it done. The
tables were properly assigned, as, for example, the chief steward
with the gentlemen and pages; the master of the horse with the
coachmen and liveries; an under steward with the bailiffs and
some husbandmen; the clerk of the kitchen with the bakers,
brewers, &amp;c. all together; and other more inferior people, under
these, in places apart. The women had their dining-room also,
and were distributed in like manner: my lady's chief woman with
the gentlewomen; the housekeeper with the maids, and some
others. The method of governing this great family was admirable
and easy, and such as might have been a pattern for any management
whatever; for, if the Duke or Duchess (who concerned herself
much more than he did; for every day of her life, in the
morning, she took her tour, and visited every office about the
house, and so was her own superintendant) observed any thing
amiss or suspicious, as a servant riding out, or the like, nothing
was said to that servant, but his immediate superior, or one of an
higher order, was sent for, who was to enquire and answer if leave
had been given, or not; if not, such servant was straight turned
away. No fault of order was passed by; for it may be concluded,
there are enough of them that pass undiscovered. All the
provisions of the family came from foreign parts, as merchandize.
Soap and candle were made in the house, so likewise the malt
was ground there; and all the drink that came to the duke's
table, was of malt sun-dried upon the leads of his house. Those
are large; and the lanthorn is in the centre of an asterisk of
glades, cut through the wood of all the country round, four or
five in a quarter, almost <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">a perte de vue</i>. Diverse of the gentlemen
cut their trees and hedges to humour his vistos; and some planted
their hills in his lines, for compliment, at their own charge.
All the trees, planted in his parks and about, were fenced with a
dry wall of stone, taken out where the tree was set. And with all
this menagery and provision, no one, that comes and goes for
visits, or affairs with the duke, (who was lord-lieutenant of four
or five counties, and Lord President of Wales,) that could observe
any thing more to do there than in any other nobleman's house;
so little of vain ostentation was to be seen there. At the entrance
where coaches ordinarily came in, the duke built a neat dwelling-house;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
but pompous stables, which would accommodate forty
horses, as well as the best stables he had. This was called the
inn, and was contrived for the ease of the suitors, as I may call
them; for, instead of half-a-crown to his servants at taking horse,
sixpence there, for form, served the turn; and no servant of his
came near a gentleman's horse; but they were brought by their
own servants, except such as lodged, whose equipages were in his
own stables.</p>

<p>"As for the duke and duchess, and their friends, there was no
time of the day without diversion. Breakfast in her gallery, that
opened into the gardens; then perhaps a deer was to be killed, or
the gardens and parks, with the several sorts of deer, to be visited;
and if it required mounting, horses of the duke's were brought for
all the company. And so, in the afternoon, when the ladies were
disposed to air, and the gentlemen with them, coaches and six
came to hold them all. At half an hour after eleven, the bell
rang to prayers, so at six in the evening; and, through a gallery,
the best company went into an aisle in the church, (so near was
it,) and the duke and duchess could see if all the family were
there. The ordinary pastime of the ladies was in a gallery on the
other side, where she had diverse gentlewomen commonly at work
upon embroidery and fringe-making; for all the beds of state were
made and finished in the house. The meats were very neat, and
not gross; no servants in livery attended, but those called gentlemen
only; and, in the several kinds, even down to the small beer,
nothing could be more choice than the table was. It was an oblong
and not an oval; and the duchess, with two daughters only,
sat at the upper end. If the gentlemen chose a glass of wine, the
civil offers were made either to go down into the vaults, which
were very large and sumptuous, or servants, at a sign given, attended
with salvers, &amp;c. and many a brisk round went about; but
no sitting at table with tobacco and healths, as the too common
use is. And this way of entertaining continued a week, while we
were there, with incomparable variety: for the duke had always
some new project, building, walling, or planting, which he would
show, and ask his friends their advice about; and nothing was
forced or strained, but easy and familiar, as if it was, and really
so I thought it to be, the common course and way of living in that
family.</p>

<p>"One thing more I must needs relate, which the duke told us
smiling, and it was this: When he was in the midst of his building,
his neighbour, the Lord Chief Justice Hales, made him a visit;
and observing the many contrivances the duke had for the disposing
of so great a family, he craved leave to suggest one to him,
which he thought would be much for his service, and it was, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
have but one door to his house, and the window of his study,
where he sat most, open upon that. This shows how hard it is
for even wise and learned men to consider things without themselves.
The children of the family were bred with a philosophical
care. No inferior servants were permitted to entertain them, lest
some mean sentiments, or foolish notions and fables, should steal
into them; and nothing was so strongly impressed upon them as
a sense of honour. Witness the Lord Arthur, who, being about
five years old, was very angry with the judge for hanging men.
The judge told him, that, if they were not hanged, they would kill
and steal. 'No,' said the little boy, 'you should make them promise
upon their honour they will not do so, and then they will
not.' It were well if this institutionary care of parents were always
correspondent in the manners of all the children; for it is
not often found to prove so." <i>Life of the Lord Keeper Guilford</i>,
p. 132.</p>

<p>When Monmouth undertook his ill-fated expedition, Albemarle
marched against him with the militia of Devon; but the ex-chancellor
of Cambridge baffled the attempts of his successor to coop
him up at Lyme, and compelled him to retreat with some disorder.
Monmouth, after assuming the title of king, sent a summons
to Albemarle to claim his allegiance, who returned a cold and
contemptuous answer. In 1687, Albemarle was sent abroad as
governor of Jamaica; in which island he died.</p>

the Cabal administration, and secretary of state. He was finally
Lord Chamberlain, and through many turns of politics retained
the favour of Charles II., perhaps as much from making
himself useful in his pleasures, as from the recollection of his
faithful attachment. He was learned, and accustomed to business;
but, being naturally of a slow understanding, and having acquired
a formal manner during his stay in Spain, much enhanced
by a black patch which he wore to conceal a wound on his nose,
there was something ridiculously stiff in his demeanour. Charles
II., who put no value upon a friend in comparison to a jest, is said
to have had much delight in seeing the Duke of Buckingham, or
any of his gay courtiers, by the help of a black patch and a white
staff, enact Harry Bennet. Mulgrave thinks, that a ludicrous
idea being thus associated with Arlington, and all that concerned
him, he came to be generally thought a man of less abilities, than
he really was. He adds, he was of a generous temper, and served
his friends warmly. Being once ungratefully used by one whom he
had benefited, he asked Mulgrave, what effect he thought it would
have upon him; and prevented his answer, by saying, it should
neither cool his present friendship, nor prevent him of the greatest
happiness of his life, which was to serve the first deserving person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
that fell in his way.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Although the Duke of York disliked
Arlington, yet he suffered him to retain his situation at court. His
religion may have saved him from disgrace; for Arlington was
privately a Catholic, and avowed himself to be so on his death-bed.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>

<p>Lady Isabella Bennet, only daughter and heiress of the Earl of
Arlington, was married to Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Grafton, second
son of Charles II. by the Duchess of Cleveland. This match was
against the inclination of the duke's mother; for Derrick says, he
saw a letter from her to Danby, dated at Paris, in 1675, thanking
him for endeavouring to prevent the match. The Duke of
Grafton was bred to the sea. After Monmouth had taken the
popular courses which we have reviewed, the king endeavoured to
set Grafton, though inferior in all personal accomplishments, in
opposition to him, in the hearts of the people. He was appointed
steward of the Loyal Apprentices' entertainment,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> and otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>placed in the public eye, as the rival of Monmouth. He also
was admitted to share his more profitable spoils, getting one of
the regiments of the guards, formerly under Monmouth's command,
when the Duke of Richmond was made Master of the Horse.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
Grafton was sent against Monmouth on his landing in the west,
and attempted to beat up his rear with a body of horse, as he
marched towards Frome; but was defeated, and very nearly made
prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The Duke of Grafton participated in the general discontent
which James II's measures excited through the kingdom,
and remonstrated against them with professional frankness. The king
ridiculed a seaman's pretensions to tenderness of conscience; and
Grafton answered sturdily, that "if he had not much religion himself,
he belonged to a party who had." He was with the king
when he headed his army to march against the Prince of Orange,
and joined with Churchill, in exhorting him to hazard a battle.
We must hope, that they meant to share the risque which they
recommended; and that it was only a consciousness that the king
had deserted his own cause, which induced them to go over to the
prince, when their counsel was rejected. On the 28th September,
1690, the Duke of Grafton was mortally wounded at the siege of
Cork, as he commanded the squadron which covered the landing.
He seems to have been a brave, rough, hardy-tempered man, and
would probably have made a figure as a naval officer.</p>

<p>Lewis Duras, Earl of Feversham, brother of the French Marshals
Duras and De Lorge, and nephew to the famous Marshal Turenne.
He was born of a Huguenot family, and retained his religion, or
the form of it, when both his brothers conformed to the Catholic
church. The Duke of York's opportune return from Flanders is
said, by Sir John Reresby, to have been planned by this nobleman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
who is, therefore, introduced here with singular propriety.
He is said to have been brave; but appears, from the
only remarkable action in which he was ever engaged, to have
been a bad general, and a cruel man. James II., who had a high
esteem for Feversham, placed him at the head of that body of
disciplined troops, which checked the career of Monmouth. He
advanced to Bridgewater, of which Monmouth had got possession,
with some of the finest regiments in the service, and 30 field pieces.
The unfortunate adventurer seemed to have no refuge left, but to
disperse his forces, and fly for his safety; when the mode in which
Feversham conducted himself gave him a fair chance for victory
and a crown. He encamped in the open country, three
miles from the enemy, with only a dry ditch in his front; dispersed
his cavalry in the neighbouring hamlets, and retired quietly
to bed, without either sending out reconnoitering parties, or
establishing advanced posts.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> It is no wonder, that, that in such a
careless state, he should have been completely surprised; it is only
singular, that, even allowing for the cowardice of Lord Grey,
who fled, instead of performing the safe and easy duty committed
to him of firing the horse-quarters of Feversham's army, he should
have been able to recover the consequences of his negligence.
Monmouth's men fought for three hours after they had been deserted
by their cavalry, with the innate courage of English peasants.
Feversham was still hard pressed, notwithstanding the gallant
assistance afforded him by Dumbarton; when the Bishop of Bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
and Wells decided the day, by causing the artillery to be turned
upon the flank of Monmouth's followers. When they had given
way, Feversham exhibited more of the cold-blooded cruelty of his
country, than he had done of their genius and fiery valour, while the
battle lasted. The military bishop also proved himself a better
lawyer than the general, as he had shewn himself in the fight a better
soldier; but it was not till a warm expostulation was made on
his part that the general ceased to execute the prisoners by martial
law, and reserved them to a still more cruel fate from the
forms of law, as administered by the brutal Jefferies. Neither
Feversham's blunders, nor his brutality, seemed to lessen his merit
in the eye of his sovereign. He received the order of the
Garter, on the 31st July, 1685, probably on the vacancy occasioned
by the Duke of Monmouth's death, whose memory
was on this occasion treated with signal ignominy.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> At the
time of the Revolution, Lord Feversham was commander in chief,
and proved himself incapable of taking any spirited steps for
James's interest; for the army he commanded, though the officers
were disaffected, would probably have fought, had they
been once fairly committed in opposition to the Dutch. When
the king resolved to abandon everything, and forsake his kingdom,
he left behind, a letter to Feversham, stating that he should not
expect his troops at present to expose themselves. The general
might have secured a part of his forces, by retreating along with
the high-spirited Viscount of Dundee, who marched back into
Scotland with the Scottish regiments; but Feversham was a man
of another mould, and rather chose to augment the general confusion,
by disbanding the army. When James was detected by
the fishermen of Kent, in his attempt to leave the kingdom, Feversham,
with a party of his guards, was sent to conduct him back to his
capital. James also chose him for the messenger, when, yielding
to sad necessity, he sent a letter to the Prince of Orange, inviting
him to St James's. With a view, doubtless, to increase the terror
of the king's mind, and precipitate his intention of a second flight,
the prince arrested the bearer of this humiliating embassy. This
was the last public occasion on which James had occasion to employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the services of the unmilitary nephew of the great Turenne,
whose name is connected with the most blame-worthy and most
melancholy passages of his reign.</p>

<p>These lines, which sufficiently vouch their author to have been
Tate, refer to Sir Heneage a Finch, an eminent lawyer, who was first
attorney-general, and, upon Shaftesbury losing his seals, succeeded
him as Lord Keeper. He was a most incorruptible judge, and
could not be swayed in his decisions even by the king's interference,
which upon all political occasions was omnipotent with
him. He was a good lawyer, and a ready orator; but upon this
last accomplishment, he set, as all lawyers do, rather too high a
value: for they, whose profession necessarily leads them often
to speak against their own opinion, and often to make much of
trifles, are apt to lose, in the ingenuity of their arguments, the
power of making a real impression upon the bosom of their hearers.
North says, that the business, rather than the justice, of
the court, flourished exceedingly under Finch; for he was a
formalist, and took exceeding pleasure in encouraging and listening
to nice distinctions of law, instead of taking a broad view of
the equity of each case. He was a steady and active supporter of
the Tory party on all occasions; in reward of which, he was created
Earl of Nottingham. After a long and lingering disease, which
terminated in a deep depression of spirits, this great lawyer died
in 1682, and was succeeded by Lord Guilford, as Lord Keeper.</p>

<p>Sir Roger L'Estrange was descended of a good family in Norfolk,
and during the civil war was in arms for the king.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Being
taken prisoner by the parliament, he was condemned to die, but
found means to obtain a pardon. He was a good performer on
the violin; a quality which recommended him to Cromwell, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
whose government he lived, if we may trust one of his antagonists,
in ease and affluence; a circumstance with which he was afterwards
as often reproached as our author with his panegyric on the
Protector. The instant, however, that the restoration of monarchy
approached, L'Estrange was among the first to hail it, and stepped
forth to answer a pamphlet of Milton, on the subject of a republic,
by a retort, which he irreverently entitled, "No Blind Guides."
After the Restoration, he was the great champion of the court, the
high church, and the Tory party. His principal vehicle of political
instruction was the "Observator," a paper published twice
a week; but he also edited another, called "Heraclitus Ridens;"
and, independently of both, published answers, replies, rebutters,
and sur-rebutters, to every attack made upon him, besides quires
of pamphlets on all popular subjects. For these good services, he
was knighted by King James. His style is in the last degree mean,
crabbed, and low; yet he possesses some power of argument and
sarcasm. He appears to have first invented, or at least first practised
to a great extent, the foolish custom of printing emphatic passages
in a different type from the rest of the page, and thereby too
often effecting a point, which the reader is unable to trace. For
the other deeds of L'Estrange, and his numerous bead-roll of fugitive
pieces, the reader may consult the article in the Biographia.</p>

<p>The Duke of York, after a short visit to England, returned to
Scotland by sea. The vessel unfortunately struck upon a bank,
called the Lemman Ore; and the duke, with a few attendants,
who crowded into the barge, were all who escaped from the wreck.
Burnet says, that the duke showed no anxiety about the safety of
any one save his dogs and his priests, whom the bishop maliciously
classes together. Others say, he was principally interested
about Churchill, who, at the Revolution, requited his anxiety but
indifferently. The Gazette says, that when the barge put off, the
poor sailors, who remained to perish, manned the sides in the usual
honorary form, and, indifferent to their own fate, hailed the duke's
safety with three cheers; a circumstance alluded to a few lines

<p>Sir John Moor, the tory Lord Mayor, an aged and respectable citizen,
of a mild character, and even hesitating and cautious in forming
his measures, though sufficiently determined when once satisfied
of their propriety. "Which character," says North, "was cut
out for this time and public occasion; for nothing but such firmness
of mind, and manifest goodness, with a seeming passive disposition,
could have protected from those rages of violence, as very often
threatened him, and which, probably, had broke loose on any one
in his post, that had carried matters with a stern and minatory behaviour."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
He was proposed by the court-party in the city for Lord
Mayor, and, being scarcely opposed by the other faction, easily carried
his election. The Whigs were led into this blunder, by mistaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the principles, and under-rating the resolution, of the candidate.
Sir John Moor had been bred a non-conformist; and, though
he had taken the test with a view to civic honours, that was no
more than had been done by Bethel, Cornish, and others, who retained
in full vigour their sectarian principles. Besides, from the
gentleness and softness of the new Lord Mayor's demeanour, his
smooth and diffident way of talking in private, and his embarrassed
elocution in public, they conceived that, even if completely gained
by the court, he would prove too passive and timorous, to serve
them essentially against active and energetic opponents. In both
these particulars they were woefully mistaken. Sir John proved
to be most keenly disposed to second all the court measures; and he
was kept up to the pitch of resolution necessary for carrying them
through, by the constant support, encouragement, and advice of
the Duke of Ormond, whom the court employed to back him, and
who, during the contests which followed, dined with the Lord
Mayor two or three times every week.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> This election, and its consequences,
was a severe blow to the fanatical interest in the city;
the jovial custom of banquets and feasting was revived; and the
musicians, who had been long under restraint, were restored to
their privilege, which they employed in chaunting forth the praises
of Sir John the Restorer.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> More, of Morehall, was not for a

and a general revolution appeared to have taken place in
the manners, as well as the principles, of the citizens, which, under
the Whig government, had savoured not a little of the ancient days
of fanatical severity.</p>

<p>Ziph and Shimei were the Whig sheriffs in 1681; concerning
whom, see note upon Shimei in Part First. The <i>viler pair</i> were
Thomas Pilkington, and Samuel Shute, who followed out the
practice of their predecessors, in the mode of packing the juries on
political trials, and had the honour to arrange that which acquitted
the Earl of Shaftesbury. They were much hated by the
court; and, when they came with the recorder to invite the King
to dine with the Lord Mayor, Charles forgot his usual politeness
so far, as to answer sternly, "so agreeable was the city's invitation,
that he would accept it, though brought by messengers so unwelcome
to him as these two sheriffs."<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Sir John Moor had a
most violent contest with these two persons, concerning the election
of sheriffs for the ensuing year, about which the court were
exceedingly anxious.</p>

<p>It had been customary, when these elections were matters of
little consequence, that the Lord Mayor designated a citizen to
hold the office of sheriff, by the ceremony of drinking to him, and
sending him the cup. It was agreed by the court, that this custom
should be revived, as throwing the choice of one of the sheriffs
into the hands of their partizan, Sir John Moor. This being settled,
the Mayor, in full form, drank to Dudley North, brother of
the Lord Keeper Guilford, a Levant merchant, who accepted of
that expensive office, to please his brother, and to serve the court.
The popular party determined to controvert this election; denying
that a sheriff could be elected otherwise than by the Livery,
and proposed Papillon and Dubois, sturdy Whigs, for their candidates.
The court, on the other hand, contending that North was
duly and incontrovertibly elected, by the jolly mode already mentioned,
proposed a Mr Box for the other sheriff, whose office only
they allowed to be vacant. The Common Hall, held on this occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
was as tumultuary as a raging tempest. At length the Lord Mayor,
with the party who denied there were two vacancies, withdrew;
while the country party remained, and polled for Papillon and
Dubois, under the direction of Shute and Pilkington, the last year's
sheriffs. The court, affecting to consider this as a riot, interfered
on that pretext, and a warrant was granted for committing the
sheriffs to the Tower. Having found bail to answer for a misdemeanour,
they returned to the charge with the same ardour as
ever, and were actually about to complete their poll, when the
hall was adjourned by the orders of the Lord Mayor. The whole
weight of the court was necessary to keep up the Lord Mayor's heart
at this crisis. He was sent for to the Privy Council, encouraged,
soothed, schooled, and finally assured, by a writing under the
Lord Keeper's hand, that he might adjourn the Common Hall, &amp;c.
as he thought proper. Thus heartened, the Lord Mayor assumed
to himself the whole management of the poll, although the sheriffs
opened books for another, and, denying the legality of any election,
excepting his own, declared Box duly returned. This citizen,
however, apprehensive of the consequences of acting under so
dubious a nomination, fined off, and declined to serve. One Rich
was found, with more zeal and courage; and, during the tumult of
a Common Hall, which resounded with the cries of "no election,"
&amp;c. this gentleman was elected sheriff by a few of the
Lord Mayor's partizans, and declared duly returned by the Lord
Mayor, who immediately proceeded to dissolve the Common Hall.
North and Rich were accordingly sworn in as sheriffs for the
year; but a guard of the Train Bands was necessary to protect
them, while they thus qualified themselves for entering on their
office.</p>

<p>This contest was followed by another, for the office of Lord
Mayor. Gould, the popular candidate, was returned by a considerable
majority; but, upon a scrutiny, the court-party, by dint
of real or pretended disqualifications, gained such an advantage,
that Pritchard, their candidate, was returned by a majority of
fourteen voices.</p>

<p>The importance of these elections was soon visible. The popular
party were utterly disheartened, and their leaders exposed to
the same practices from packing juries, which they had themselves
employed. The court used their victory remorselessly. Pilkington,
the ex-sheriff, was found liable in 100,000l. damages, for having
said that "the Duke of York had fired the city, and was now come
to cut all their throats." Those concerned in carrying on the
double poll, were severely fined, as guilty of a riot. Sir Patience
Ward, an alderman of the popular party, was declared obnoxious
to a charge of perjury, for an inconsistence in his evidence on Pilkington's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
trial.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> In short, the royal vengeance was felt by all
who had been active in opposition to the court.</p>

<p>But the extent of the court's victory was best evinced by the
conduct of Shaftesbury; who, seeing his strong-hold, the magistracy
of the city, thus invaded, and occupied by his enemies,
fled from his house in Aldersgate-street, and for some time lay
concealed in Wapping, trusting for his safety to the very lowest of
mankind. From this hiding place, he sent forth messages to the
other heads of the party, in which he urged the most desperate
measures. But, finding it impossible to combine the various persons
concerned in one plan of enterprize, and sensible of the
danger of discovery, which each day's delay rendered more imminent,
after a bitter contest between fear and rage, he fled to
Amsterdam. His retreat was followed by the trial of the conspirators
in the Rye-house Plot; and doubtless, the court, on that
occasion, knew well how to avail themselves of the power of selecting
juries so long possessed by their enemies, and now in their
own hands. During the short remainder of this reign, the king's
authority was paramount and supreme; his enemies were at his
feet, and not a whisper of opposition disturbed his repose;&mdash;a deceitful
and delusive calm, which his unfortunate successor soon
saw changed into a tempest.</p>

<p class="p3">THE MEDAL.</p>


<p>The Medal was published in the beginning of March 1682,
about four months after the appearance of the first part of "Absalom
and Achitophel," and eight months before the publication
of the second part of that poem. The circumstances, which led to
it, require us to notice Shaftesbury's imprisonment and acquittal.</p>

<p>On the 2d July, 1681, the Earl of Shaftesbury was apprehended,
by virtue of a warrant from council, and after his papers had
been seized, and he himself had undergone an examination, was
committed to the Tower. Upon the 24th November, 1681, a bill
for high-treason was presented against him to the grand jury of
Middlesex. When the witnesses were adduced, the jurors demanded,
that they might be examined in private; and Pilkington,
the Whig sheriff, required, that they should be examined separately.
Both requests were refused by the court. One Booth was
then examined, who swore, that Lord Shaftesbury had told him,
he intended to carry down to the Oxford parliament a party of
fifty gentlemen, and their servants, armed and mounted, to be
commanded by a Captain Wilkinson; and that his Lordship stated
this force to be provided, for the purpose of repelling any
attack which the king's guards might make on the parliament, and,
if necessary, to take the king from his bad advisers by force, and
bring him to the city of London. The witness, said he, was invited
by Wilkinson to be one of this band, and provided himself with a
good horse and arms for the service; which was prevented by the
sudden dissolution of the Oxford parliament. Seven other witnesses,
Smith, Turberville, Haynes, and three persons called Macnamara,
swore, that Shaftesbury had used to them, and each
of them individually, the most treasonable expressions concerning
the king's person; had declared he had no more title to the crown
than the Duke of Buckingham; that he deserved to be deposed;
and that he, Shaftesbury, would dethrone him, and convert the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
into a commonwealth. Here was enough of swearing at least
to make a true bill. But the character of the witnesses was infamous;
Booth was a swindler, and could never give an account of
the stable in which he kept his pretended charger, or produce
any one who had seen it. Smith, by his own confession, had changed
his religion twice, was one of the evidences of the Popish plot,
and intimate with the villain Oates. Turberville stood in the
same predicament of an infamous fellow, and an evidence for the
plot; he is said to have apologised for his apostacy, by saying
plainly, that "the Protestant citizens had forsaken him, and, God
damn him, he would not starve." The other witnesses were Irishmen,
and there was something remarkable in their history. They
had pretended to discover a Catholic plot in Ireland, which, if one
had existed any where, was doubtless the place where it might
have been found. Their evidence, however, contained pretty
much such a raw-head and bloody-bones story as that of Oates,
and equally unworthy of credit. Yet Shaftesbury constituted himself
their protector, and had them brought over to England, where he
doubtless intended, that their Irish plot should be as warmly
agitated in the Oxford parliament, as the English conspiracy in
that of 1679. Macnamara's "Narrative of the Conspiracy" is
dedicated to his Lordship, because it was not only known to the
dedicator, "but to the whole Christian world, how conspicuous
his Lordship had been for his indefatigable zeal and vigilance over
the safety of his majesty's most sacred person, and the welfare of
the whole extent of his dominions." The sudden dissolution of
the Oxford parliament, which had such important consequences
in various respects, prevented the prosecution of the Irish plot.
Besides, it seems to have escaped even Shaftesbury, that popular
terror, the most powerful of engines, loses its excitability by too
frequent alarms. The theme of a plot began to be listened to
with indifference. That of Ireland fell to the ground, without
exciting clamour or terror, but the witnesses remained. There is
a story of some Irish recruits, who, being detected in a brawl, justified
themselves, by saying, they were paid by the king for fighting,
and it was quite the same to them where they fought, or with
whom. The witnesses were equally sedulous in their vocation, and
equally indifferent about the application of their labours; for,
finding the court had obtained an ascendency, they readily turned
with the tide, and bore evidence, as we have seen, against their original
protector and encourager. The Tories basely availed themselves
of the readiness with which this hungry pack of bloodhounds
turned against their huntsman, and triumphantly claimed
for them the same credit which the Whigs had demanded in former
cases; although they must have been conscious, that they
were employing the worst arts, as well as the most infamous implements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
of their enemies. Besides the infamy of these men's character,
their story was very improbable; as it could hardly be supposed,
that Shaftesbury, the veteran leader of a party, should have
committed himself so deeply in unnecessary and unreserved communication
with these vulgar banditti, or expressed himself against
the king in such low and gross language as they imputed to him.</p>

<p>Such being the oral testimony, and such its defects, the crown
lawyers endeavoured to aid it, by founding upon certain papers
found in Shaftesbury's study. One of these contained the names
of the principal persons in the nation, divided into two lists, one
titled, <cite>Worthy Men</cite>, and the other, <cite>Men Worthy</cite>; which last contained
the principal Tories, and the legend was understood to
mean, "men worthy to be hanged." This was too enigmatical to
bear much argument. But there was also found a draught of an
association against Popery, in which many dangerous topics were
stated. It was thereby declared, that the Papist Plot was still advancing,
and that the Catholics had been highly encouraged by
James Duke of York; that mercenary forces had been levied, and
kept on foot, contrary to law, and to the danger of the king's person:
Therefore the persons associating were to bind themselves
to defend, first the Protestant religion, and then the king's person
and liberties of the subject, against all encroachment and usurpation
of arbitrary power, and to endeavour to disband all such mercenary
forces as were kept up in and about the city of London, to
the great amazement and terror of all the good people of the land;
also, never to consent that the Duke of York, or any professed
Papist, should succeed to the crown, but by all lawful means, and
by force of arms if necessary, to resist and oppose his so doing.
By a still more formidable clause, it was provided, that the subscribers
were to receive orders from the parliament if sitting; but
if it should be dissolved, from the majority of the association itself.
Lastly, that no one should separate from the rest of the association,
on pain of being by the others prosecuted and suppressed,
as a perjured person and public enemy. Much dangerous,
and even treasonable, inference may be drawn from this model.
But it was only an unsigned scroll, and did not appear to have
been framed, or even revised and approved of, by Shaftesbury.</p>

<p>With such evidence against him, Shaftesbury might have gone
safely before a jury of indifferent men, could such have been found.
But the Whig sheriffs, Shute and Pilkington, left nothing to hazard,
and took good care the assize should consist of men picked
out of the very centre of their own party. We recognize the
names of Godfrey, brother to Sir Edmondbury; of Papillon and
Dubois, the Whig candidates for the shrievalty against North
and Rich; of Sir Samuel Barnardiston, who maintained a furious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
action against the high-sheriff of Suffolk, for a double return; of
Shepherd, the wine-merchant, at whose house the Duke of Monmouth,
Lord Russel, &amp;c. afterwards held their meetings; of Edwin,
the presbyterian, and others less noted in history, but not less remarkable
at the time for the violence of their party-zeal. After a
short consideration, they returned the bill <i>Ignoramus</i>; upon which
there was a shout of continued applause in the court, which lasted for
an hour, and the city, in the evening, blazed with bonfires, to celebrate
the escape of their Protestant leader. Such was the history
of this noted trial, which took place at a time when the course of
law had lost its deep still channel, and all causes were carried by
a fierce impetuous torrent, which threatened to break down the
banks, and become a general inundation. Accustomed to a pure
administration of justice, we now look back with disgust and horror
upon times, when, to bring in a just verdict, it was necessary
to assemble a packed jury.</p>

<p>The triumph of the Whigs was unbounded; and, among other
symptoms of exultation, it displayed itself in that which gave rise
to this poem of Dryden. This was a medal of Lord Shaftesbury,
struck by William Bower, an artist, who had executed some popular
pieces allusive to the Roman Catholic plot.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The obverse
presented the bust of the earl, with the legend, <span class="smcap">Antonio Comiti
De Shaftesbury</span>; the reverse, a view of London, the bridge,
and the Tower; the sun is rising above the Tower, and just in the
act of dispersing a cloud; the legend around the exergue is <span class="smcap">Lætamur</span>,
and beneath is the date of his acquittal, 24th <span class="smcap">November</span>,
1681. The partizans of the acquitted patriot wore these medals
at their breasts; and care was taken that this emblem should be
made as general as possible.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>The success of "Absalom and Achitophel" made the Tories
look to our author as the only poet whose satire might check, or
ridicule, the popular triumph of Shaftesbury. If the following
anecdote, which Spence has given on the authority of a Catholic
priest, a friend of Pope, be absolutely correct, Charles himself
engaged Dryden to write on this theme. "One day as the
king was walking in the Mall, and talking with Dryden, he said,
'If I was a poet, and I think I am poor enough to be one, I would
write a poem on such a subject, in the following manner.' He
then gave him the plan of "The Medal." Dryden took the hint,
carried the poem, as soon as it was written, to the king, and had
a present of a hundred broad pieces for it."</p>

<p>The merits of "The Medal," as a satirical poem, are universally
acknowledged; nor does it greatly suffer from being placed, as
the subject naturally invites, in comparison with "Absalom and
Achitophel." The latter, as a group of figures, presents greater
scope and variety, and may be therefore more generally interesting
than the portrait of an individual; but it does not more fully
display the abilities of the artist. Nothing can be more forcibly
described, than the whole of Shaftesbury's political career; and,
to use the nervous language of Johnson, "the picture of a man,
whose propensions to mischief are such, that his best actions are
but inability of wickedness, is very skilfully delineated, and strongly
coloured." The comparison of his best and most politic councils,
to the cures affected by those called <i>white witches</i>, whom it
was unlawful to consult, because, even in accomplishing innocent
purposes, they used infernal arts, is poignantly severe. The
succeeding lines, in which the poet ridicules bitterly that appeal
to the people, which the demagogues of that, as of all periods,
were desirous to represent as the criterion of truth, contains the
essence of all that an hundred philosophers can say upon the topic.
His stern and indignant picture of the citizens of London, unjust as
it is, if meant to express their general character, is, in individual instances,
too often verified. That looseness which habitual chicane in
trade introduces into mercantile morality; that bustling activity,
which, however meritorious when within its sphere, is so apt to
extend itself where its exertion is only mischievous and absurd;
and that natural turn to democracy, which arises from frequenting
popular meetings and from ambition of civic honours; that half-acquaintance
with the affairs of other countries, and half-intimacy
with the laws of our own, acquired in the course of mercantile
transactions,&mdash;all combine, but too often, to turn an useful sober
citizen, into a meddling, pragmatical, opinionative politician. The
strong and gloomy picture of the fanatics, which succeeds, describes
a race of men now in a great measure extinct, of whom the influence,
though declining, even in the poet's time, continued to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
powerful, and which had, in the preceding generation, prostrated
before them both the mitre and the throne. The comparison of the
fanatical ideas of religion entertained by these dissenting teachers,
with the supposed principles of the libertine and latitudinarian
Shaftesbury, gave scope for some nervous satire, and led the author
naturally to consider the probable result of the schemes of these
incongruous allies. These he predicts, according to the progress of
things after the great civil war, to be successively the dominion of
presbytery, and depression of the gentry; the insurrection of the
independents, and other sects, against their spiritual tyranny;
quarrels between the civil and military leaders; the commons
destroying the peerage; a democratical republic; a military tyranny;
and, by the blessing of heaven, a restoration of the rightful
heir. All these scenes had already passed at no distant period;
and now, while the sword was yet in the sheath, though the hand
was upon its hilt, the masterly and energetic language in which
they are detailed may have tempted many to pause and think,
whether the evils, of which they complained, deserved the risque
of so desperate a remedy.</p>

<p>Such is the plan of this admirable poem. The language is as
striking as the ideas and subject. The illustrations and images
are short and apposite, such as give force to the argument, and flow
easily into the diction, without appearing to have been laboured,
or brought from a distance. I fear, however, some of the scriptural
allusions are censurable, as too free, if not profane. The verse
has all the commanding emphasis, with which Dryden, beyond any
other poet, knew how to body forth and adorn his poetical arguments.
One Alexandrine is prolonged two syllables beyond
the usual length; a circumstance hardly worth notice, were it not
to show the sharp-sighted malice of Dryden's enemies, who could
discover this single inaccuracy, if, indeed, the licence was not intentional,
amid so much sounding versification.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>As "The Medal" attracted immediate and extensive attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
the Whig champions stepped forth to the contest. "The Mushroom,"
by Edmund Hickeringell, first appeared; and, in succession,
"The Medal Reversed," by Samuel Pordage, which procured
its author a couplet in the second part of "Absalom and Achitophel;"
"The Loyal Medal Vindicated," and the "Medal of
John Bayes;" all of which, and perhaps many more, appeared in
the summer and autumn of 1681. Two satires, of a more general
nature, entitled, "Dryden's Satire to his Muse," and, "The Tory
Poets," were also published against our author in the course of
that year; a sufficient proof of the irritation of that party,
whose chief he had now twice held up to public detestation.&mdash;The
popularity of "The Medal" did not cease with the crisis
which gave it birth; it went through many editions, and only became
less known, when successive changes had totally worn away
all remembrance of the intrigues of the eminent politician against
whom it was directed. Johnson has said, "It is now not much
read, nor perhaps generally understood; yet, a slight acquaintance
with the history of the period removes all obscurity; and, though
we cannot sympathize with the fervour of politics which it contains,
the poetry has claims to popularity, widely independent of
the temporary nature of the subject."</p>

<p>As the reader is now to take a long farewell of Lord Shaftesbury,
it may not be unnecessary to remind him, that, when freed
from the accusation of high treason, the earl continued to agitate
plans of opposition to the government, which became more and
more violent, as the ascendency of the court became more powerful,
until open force seemed to be the only means left of accomplishing
what undoubtedly he had at first hoped to carry through
by political intrigue. At length he found it necessary to fly from
his house in Aldersgate-Street, and take refuge in the suburbs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the city, from whence he sent messages to his associates, urging
them to take arms. But he was now doomed to experience what
his ardent temper had before prevented him from considering.
When they came to the crisis, the different views and dispositions
of the allies began to discover themselves. Russell limited his
wishes to security for liberty; Monmouth stipulated his own succession
on Charles' death; Sidney demanded a free commonwealth;
and all dreaded Shaftesbury, who, they were sensible, was determined
to be at the head of the kind of government adopted, whatever
that might be. Nor were their tempers less discordant than
their plans. While an inferior order of conspirators were organizing
plans for assassinating the whole royal family, Monmouth was
anxious for the life of his father, Russell averse to shedding the
blood of his countrymen, Grey, Howard, and Trenchard, from
meaner motives, unwilling to encounter the dangers of war. After
a desperate threat to commence the rising, and make the honour
and danger all his own, Shaftesbury at length fled to Holland,
where he landed in November 1682. The magistrates of Amsterdam
gave him welcome, and enrolled him among their citizens, to
evade any claim by the court of England on his person; yet they
failed not to remind him of his former declaration, of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Delenda est
Carthago</i>, accompanying the freedom which they presented to him
with these words: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ab nostra Carthagine, nondum deleta, salutem
accipe</i>. Here, while pondering the consequences of former intrigues,
and perhaps adjusting new machinations, Shaftesbury was
seized with the gout in his stomach, and expired on the 21st January,
1682-3.</p>

<p>To sift the character of this extraordinary man, and divide
his virtues from his vices, his follies from his talents, would be a
difficult, perhaps an impossible task. Charles is said to have borne
testimony, that he had more law than all his judges, and more
divinity than all his bishops. But his shining qualities were sullied
by that inordinate ambition, which brought its own punishment,
in an unworthy flight, an untimely, at least a precipitated,
death, and a dubious reputation.</p>

<p><span class="fontsize">F</span><span class="smcap">or</span> to whom can I dedicate this poem with so
much justice as to you? 'Tis the representation of
your own hero; 'tis the picture drawn at length,
which you admire and prize so much in little. None
of your ornaments are wanting; neither the landscape
of your Tower, nor the rising sun, nor the
<i>anno domini</i> of your new sovereign's coronation.
This must needs be a grateful undertaking to your
whole party; especially to those who have not been
so happy as to purchase the original. I hear the
graver has made a good market of it; all his kings
are bought up already, or the value of the remainder
so enhanced, that many a poor Polander,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> who
would be glad to worship the image, is not able to
go to the cost of him, but must be content to see
him here. I must confess I am no great artist; but
sign-post painting will serve the turn to remember
a friend by, especially when better is not to be had.
Yet, for your comfort, the lineaments are true; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
though he sat not five times to me, as he did to B,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
yet I have consulted history; as the Italian painters
do, when they would draw a Nero or a Caligula:
though they have not seen the man, they can
help their imagination by a statue of him, and find
out the colouring from Suetonius and Tacitus. Truth
is, you might have spared one side of your medal;
the head would be seen to more advantage if it
were placed on a spike of the Tower, a little nearer
to the sun, which would then break out to better
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>You tell us, in your preface to the "No-protestant
Plot,"<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> that you shall be forced hereafter to leave
off your modesty; I suppose you mean that little
which is left you, for it was worn to rags when
you put out this medal. Never was there practised
such a piece of notorious impudence in the face of
an established government. I believe, when he is
dead, you will wear him in thumb-rings, as the Turks
did Scanderbeg, as if there were virtue in his bones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
to preserve you against monarchy. Yet all this
while you pretend not only zeal for the public
good, but a due veneration for the person of the
king. But all men, who can see an inch before
them, may easily detect those gross fallacies. That
it is necessary for men in your circumstances to
pretend both, is granted you; for without them
there could be no ground to raise a faction. But I
would ask you one civil question, what right has
any man among you, or any association of men, to
come nearer to you, who, out of parliament, cannot
be considered in a public capacity, to meet, as you
daily do, in factious clubs, to vilify the government
in your discourses, and to libel it in all your writings?
Who made you judges in Israel? Or how is
it consistent with your zeal for the public welfare,
to promote sedition? Does your definition of <em>loyal</em>,
which is, "to serve the king according to the
laws," allow you the licence of traducing the executive
power with which you own he is invested?
You complain that his majesty has lost the love and
confidence of his people; and by your very urging
it, you endeavour what in you lies to make him
lose them. All good subjects abhor the thought of
arbitrary power, whether it be in one or many: if
you were the patriots you would seem, you would
not at this rate incense the multitude to assume it;
for no sober man can fear it, either from the king's
disposition, or his practice; or even where you
would odiously lay it, from his ministers. Give us
leave to enjoy the government and benefit of laws
under which we were born, and which we desire to
transmit to our posterity. You are not the trustees
of the public liberty: and if you have not right to
petition in a crowd,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> much less have you to intermeddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
in the management of affairs, or to arraign
what you do not like; which, in effect, is every
thing that is done by the king and council. Can
you imagine, that any reasonable man will believe
you respect the person of his majesty, when it is
apparent that your seditious pamphlets are stuffed
with particular reflections on him? If you have the
confidence to deny this, it is easy to be evinced
from a thousand passages, which I only forbear to
quote, because I desire they should die and be forgotten.
I have perused many of your papers; and
to show you that I have, the third part of your "No-protestant
Plot" is much of it stolen from your dead
author's pamphlet, called the "Growth of Popery;"<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
as manifestly as Milton's "Defence of the English
People" is from Buchanan, "<i>De jure regni apud
Scotos</i>:" or your first Covenant, and new Association,
from the Holy League of the French Guisards.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
Any one, who reads Davila, may trace your practices
all along. There were the same pretences for
reformation and loyalty, the same aspersions of the
king, and the same grounds of a rebellion. I know
not whether you will take the historian's word, who
says it was reported, that Poltrot, a Huguenot, murdered
Francis Duke of Guise, by the instigations of
Theodore Beza, or that it was a Huguenot minister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
otherwise called a Presbyterian, (for our church abhors
so devilish a tenet,) who first writ a treatise of
the lawfulness of deposing and murdering kings of
a different persuasion in religion; but I am able
to prove, from the doctrine of Calvin, and principles
of Buchanan, that they set the people above
the magistrate; which, if I mistake not, is your
own fundamental, and which carries your loyalty
no farther than your liking. When a vote of the
House of Commons goes on your side, you are as
ready to observe it, as if it were passed into a law;
but, when you are pinched with any former, and yet
unrepealed act of parliament, you declare, that, in
some cases, you will not be obliged by it. The passage
is in the same third part of the "No-protestant
Plot," and is too plain to be denied. The late copy
of your intended association, you neither wholly justify
nor condemn;<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> but as the Papists, when they are
unopposed, fly out into all the pageantries of worship,
but, in times of war, when they are hard
pressed by arguments, lie close intrenched behind
the council of Trent, so now, when your affairs are
in a low condition, you dare not pretend that to be
a legal combination, but whensoever you are afloat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
I doubt not but it will be maintained and justified
to purpose, for, indeed, there is nothing to defend
it but the sword; it is the proper time to say any
thing when men have all things in their power.</p>

<p>In the mean time, you would fain be nibbling at
a parallel betwixt this association, and that in the
time of Queen Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> But there is this small
difference betwixt them, that the ends of the one
are directly opposite to the other: one, with the
queen's approbation and conjunction, as head of it;
the other, without either the consent or knowledge
of the king, against whose authority it is manifestly
designed. Therefore you do well to have recourse
to your last evasion, that it was contrived
by your enemies, and shuffled into the papers that
were seized, which yet you see the nation is not so
easy to believe as your own jury; but the matter is
not difficult, to find twelve men in Newgate who
would acquit a malefactor.</p>

<p>I have only one favour to desire of you at parting;
that, when you think of answering this poem,
you would employ the same pens against it, who
have combated with so much success against "Absalom
and Achitophel;" for then you may assure yourselves
of a clear victory, without the least reply.
Rail at me abundantly; and, not to break a custom,
do it without wit: by this method you will gain a
considerable point, which is wholly to wave the answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
of my arguments.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Never own the bottom
of your principles, for fear they should be treason.
Fall severely on the miscarriages of government;
for, if scandal be not allowed, you are no free-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
subjects. If God has not blessed you with the talent
of rhyming, make use of my poor stock, and
welcome; let your verses run upon my feet; and
for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads, reduced
to the last extremity of sense, turn my own lines
upon me, and, in utter despair of your satire, make
me satirise myself.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Some of you have been driven
to this bay already; but, above all the rest, commend
me to the non-conformist parson, who writ
the "Whip and Key." I am afraid it is not read
so much as the piece deserves, because the bookseller
is every week crying help, at the end of his
Gazette, to get it off. You see I am charitable
enough to do him a kindness, that it may be published
as well as printed; and that so much skill in
Hebrew derivations may not lie for waste-paper in
the shop: Yet, I half suspect he went no farther
for his learning, than the index of Hebrew names
and etymologies, which is printed at the end of
some English bibles. If Achitophel signify "the
brother of a fool," the author of that poem will pass
with his readers for the next of kin; and perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
it is the relation that makes the kindness.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Whatever
the verses are, buy them up, I beseech you, out
of pity; for I hear the conventicle is shut up, and
the brother of Achitophel out of service.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>Now, footmen, you know, have the generosity
to make a purse for a member of their society, who
has had his livery pulled over his ears; and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
protestant socks<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> are bought up among you, out of
veneration to the name. A dissenter in poetry from
sense and English, will make as good a protestant
rhymer, as a dissenter from the church of England a
protestant parson. Besides, if you encourage a young
beginner, who knows but he may elevate his style
a little above the vulgar epithets of "profane, and
saucy Jack," and "atheistic scribbler," with which
he treats me, when the fit of enthusiasm is strong
upon him; by which well-mannered and charitable
expressions, I was certain of his sect before I knew
his name. What would you have more of a man?
He has damned me in your cause from Genesis to
the Revelations; and has half the texts of both the
Testaments against me, if you will be so civil to
yourselves as to take him for your interpreter, and
not to take them for Irish witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> After all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
perhaps, you will tell me, that you retained him only
for the opening of your cause, and that your main
lawyer is yet behind. Now, if it so happen he
meet with no more reply than his predecessors, you
may either conclude that I trust to the goodness of
my cause, or fear my adversary, or disdain him, or
what you please; for the short of it is, it is indifferent
to your humble servant, whatever your party
says or thinks of him.</p>

  <div class="i0">His sovereign's right, by patience half betrayed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Waked his avenging genius to its aid.</div>
  <div class="i0">Blest muse, whose wit with such a cause was crowned,</div>
  <div class="i0">And blest the cause that such a champion found;</div>
  <div class="i0">With chosen verse upon the foe he falls,</div>
  <div class="i0">And black sedition in each quarter galls;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, like a prince with subjects forced to engage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Secure of conquest, he rebates his rage;</div>
  <div class="i0">His fury not without distinction sheds,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hurls mortal bolts but on devoted heads:</div>
  <div class="i0">To less infected members gentle found,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or spares, or else pours balm into the wound.</div>
  <div class="i0">Such generous grace the ungrateful tribe abuse,</div>
  <div class="i0">And trespass on the mercy of his muse;</div>

  <div class="i0">On these he scarce vouchsafes a scornful smile,</div>
  <div class="i0">But on their powerful patrons turns his style:</div>
  <div class="i0">A style so keen, as even from faction draws</div>
  <div class="i0">The vital poison, stabs to the heart their cause.</div>
  <div class="i0">Take then, great bard, what tribute we can raise;</div>
  <div class="i0">Accept our thanks, for you transcend our praise.</div>

<p class="p6"><a name="THE_MEDAL_NoteI" id="THE_MEDAL_NoteI"></a><a href="#MEDAL_NOTES_NoteI">Note I.</a></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Polish medal.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_431">431.</a></p>

<p>It was a standing joke among the opponents of Shaftesbury,
that he hoped to be chosen king of Poland at the vacancy, when
John Sobieski was elected. This was probably only a revival and
new edition of an improbable story, that he expected Cromwell
would have made him king of England. His supposed election,
its causes, and effects, are very humorously stated in a pamphlet
republished among Lord Somers' Tracts, already quoted, pp. 263,
358.</p>

<p>The author complains ironically, that, among the advantages of
court favour, which Lord Shaftesbury had renounced for his country,
already enumerated by one of his adherents, he had omitted
to mention a yet more dignified sacrifice:</p>

<p>"I suppose, there are very few in this kingdom, that do not
very sensibly remember the late <i>inter-regnum</i> in Poland, and how
many illustrious candidates stood fair for the election. Sobieski, indeed,
had done great things for that people; he had kept their potent
enemy, the Turk, from entering any farther upon their frontier; was
great and popular in the esteem and love of the best army, that, perhaps,
they ever had; but, that was by much too little to entitle him
to the succession of the throne, it appearing absolutely the interest
of that nation, that the great Turk was not only to be beaten,
but he must, in short, also be converted. And who so fit for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
an enterprize as he that should be promoted to the regal authority?
One that, from the high place he was to possess, might not
only administer justice to them, but salvation to the greater part
of Asia."&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon these considerations, you may imagine quickly the eyes
of the whole diet were cast upon little England, and thereupon
whom so soon as the little Lord of Shaftesbury? Polish deputies
were immediately sent, <i>post-incognito</i>, with the imperial crown
and sceptre in a cloak-bag to him. Old Blood<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> smelled it from
Bishopgate-street; and had it not been for an old acquaintance and
friendship between King Anthony the Elect, for now I must call
him so, and himself, I am credibly informed he had laid an ambush
for it at the Cock ale-house, by Temple-Bar, where some
thirty indigent bullies were eating stuffed beef, <i>helter-skelter</i>, at his
charge, on purpose to stand by and assist him at carrying off the
booty.</p>

<p>"But heaven, which I hope has ordained that no crown shall
ever suffer damage for King Anthony's sake, took care to preserve
this. For the sinister designs of the old Irish crown-monger being
yet to be doubted, this prudent prince, as I am told, having
tried and fitted it to his head, carefully sent it back again by a
trusty messenger, concealed in the husk or shell of a Holland
cheese, taken asunder merely for that purpose, and cemented again
together by an art fit for no man to know, but a king presumptive
of Poland.</p>

<p>"All things thus prepared, his election being carried in the diet
so unanimously, and so <i>nemine contradicente</i>, that no man to this
hour ever heard of it but himself, it is not to be imagined how this
little Grig was transported with the thoughts of growing into a
leviathan; he fancied himself the picture before Hobb's Commonwealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
already; nay, he stopt up his tap, as I am told, on purpose
that his dropsy might swell him big enough for his majesty,
and of a sudden grew so utter an enemy to all republics and anti-monarchical
constitutions, that from that hour he premeditated
and laid the foundation of a worse speech than that famous one
which he once uttered in our English senate&mdash;<i>Delenda est Carthago</i>.</p>

<p>"But now, upon deliberate and weighty consideration of the great
change he was to undertake, many difficulties, and of an extraordinary
nature, seemed to arise. A Protestant king being elected
to a Popish kingdom, great were the debates within himself, which
way he was to steer his course in the administration of his government,
so as to discharge his conscience, as well in the case incumbent
upon him of the souls of his people, as of the protection of
their properties and persons.</p>

<p>"The Great Turk, you have heard before, was to be converted.
Now, to bring so mighty a potentate over to the church of Rome,
seemed altogether destructive of the Protestant interest, for which,
he has been always so violent a champion; therefore it is resolved,
Protestant, and <i>true Protestant</i>, the Ottoman Emperor must be,
or nothing. But how, when that was done, to establish the same
church in his dominions? There was the great question. Whereupon,
after due consideration, he resolved, at his taking possession
of that throne, which stood gaping for him, to carry over from
hence such ministers, both of church and state, as might be proper
to advise, assist, and support him in a design so pious, though
so difficult."</p>

<p>A list is therefore made out of Shaftesbury's real or supposed
adherents, with absurd Polish terminations attached to their names,
to whom what the satirist deemed suitable offices in King Anthony's
court, are respectively assigned. Among these, the reader
will be startled to find our author himself under the following
entry:</p>

<p>"<i>Jean Drydenurtziz.</i> Our poet laureat for writing panegyrics
upon Oliver Cromwell, and libels against his present master, King
Charles II. of England.</p>

<p>"<i>Tom Shadworiski.</i> His deputy."</p>

<p>From which it appears, that Dryden, at the time of this pasquinade's
being written, was considered as disaffected to the court.</p>

<p>The joke of Shaftesbury's election to the Polish throne having
been once thrown out, was echoed, and re-echoed, through an hundred
ballads, till it ceased to be a joke at all. The reader must
have frequently remarked such allusions; we have, for instance, the
following songs:</p>

<p>"Dagon's Fall, or the Whigs Lament for Anthony, King of Poland."
(3d February, 1682-3.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>Dryden does not here do justice to Shaftesbury, who certainly
offered Charles I. the first fruits of his courage and address. Being
heir to a plentiful fortune, a member of parliament, and high
sheriff of the county of Dorset, he came to Oxford when the
civil war broke out, and though then only twenty-one or twenty-two
years of age, presented to the king a digested plan, for
compromising matters between him and his subjects in arms
against him: Charles observed, he was a very young man for so
great an undertaking; to which, with the readiness which marked
his character, he answered, that would not be the worse for the king's
affairs, provided the business was done. He had, in consequence,
a commission from the king, to promise indemnity and redress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
grievances to such of the parliamentary garrisons as would lay
down their arms. Accordingly, his plan seems to have taken
some effect; for Weymouth actually surrendered to the king, and
Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, as his stile then was, was made governor.
Some delays occurred in the course of his obtaining this
office; and whether disgusted with these, and giving scope to the
natural instability of his temper, as is intimated by Clarendon, or
offended, as Mr Locke states, at Weymouth having been plundered
by Prince Maurice's forces, he made one of those sudden
turns, of which his political career furnishes several instances,
and went over to the other side. After this, Clarendon says, that
he "gave up himself, body and soul, to the parliament, and became
an implacable enemy to the royal family." He raised forces in
Dorsetshire, with which he took Wareham by storm, in October
1644, and reduced the greater part of the county to the obedience
of the parliament. He held various high charges under the authority
of the republic. In 1645, he was sheriff of Norfolk; in
1646, sheriff of Wiltshire; and in 1651, one of that committee,
which was named for the revisal and reform of the law.</p>

<p>Shaftesbury was by no means in a hurry to submit to Cromwell's
domination, any more than he had been to join the parliament;
the uncontrouled authority of an individual, and of one
too who was inaccessible to all arts of cajoling or management,
and only acted upon his own opinions and impulses, presented to
the art and ambition of our statesman a very unpromising field of
exertion. Accordingly, he is said to have been active in opposing
the dispossession of the long parliament; and, being a member
of that convoked by the Protector in 1656, he signed the
famous protestation against the personal usurpation of Cromwell,
which occasioned a very sudden dissolution of that assembly.
But notwithstanding this occasional opposition, he sat in all Cromwell's
parliaments, was a member of his privy council, and was so
far in his favour, that he is said by his enemies to have nourished
hopes of succeeding him in his power, with which view he aimed
to become his son-in-law. Hence he is called, in the "Dream of
the Cabal,"</p>

<p>According to North, the Earl of Shaftesbury, "in all his ways
and workings, held a concert with the antimonarchists and fanatics."<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
As to his dissipation, the well-known speech of Charles II.,
and his reply, are sufficient evidence. "I believe, Shaftesbury,"
said the gay monarch, "thou art the wickedest dog in England."
"May it please your majesty," retorted the statesman, "of a <em>subject</em>
I believe I am." North, the recorder of all that was evil
concerning him, says, "whether out of inclination, custom, or
policy, I will not determine, it is certain, he was not behind hand
with the court in the modest pleasures of the time, and to what excess
of libertinism they were commonly grown, is no secret. There
was a deformed old gentleman, called Sir Paul Neal, who, they
say, sat for the picture of Sydrophel, in Hudibras; and about
town was called the Lord Shaftesbury's groom, because he watered
his mares (I forbear the vulgar word) in Hyde Park, with

<p>Whatever Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper's private political principles
might be, he failed not to take a share of power upon the
changes which so rapidly succeeded the death of Cromwell. Under
the Rump parliament, he was one of the council of state, and
a commissioner for managing the army, one of the committee to
secure the Tower, and colonel of a regiment of horse. He made
use of the influence which these situations afforded him, for hastening
the Restoration. Sir Anthony had long held a secret correspondence
with the loyal party, and was to have joined Sir
George Booth at his rising, had he not been so suddenly crushed.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>He was taxed with this intended co-operation in parliament; but
he was at least resolved not to bear witness against himself, for
he made the highest professions of his innocence, and imprecated
God's judgments on him and his posterity, if he had the slightest
communication with the king, or his friends:<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Nevertheless, he
was one of those who invited Monk into England; was the first
to supply him with a regiment of horse; was active in defeating the
schemes of Lambert; and, in conclusion, was named one of the
twelve members, who were deputed by the House of Commons to
invite the king to return to his dominions.</p>

<p>"At the time of his majesty's restoration, as a most signal testimony
of his majesty's good sentiments of his former actions, Shaftesbury
was advanced to be one of the first rank in his majesty's most
honourable privy council, and was placed above his majesty's royal
brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and even General Monk himself,
whom his majesty used to call his political father. And
about three days before his majesty's coronation, he was in the
Banquetting-house created Baron Ashley of Wimbourn, St Giles;
and another addition of honour was conferred on him, Lord Cooper
of Paulett; and at last, in the year 1672, he was made Earl of
Shaftesbury, at the same time when Duke Lauderdale, the Earl
of Arlington, and the Lord Clifford, were promoted."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> To these
honours were added substantial power and weight in the administration,

Chancellor of the Exchequer; and, on the resignation of Lord
Keeper Bridgeman, became Lord High Chancellor of England. In
this high station, he furthered, with all his policy and eloquence,
the union with France against Holland, and the breach of the
triple league; fatal measures, which tended to the destruction of
our natural barrier against the universal dominion of France. It
is probable, that Shaftesbury's ardent spirit flattered itself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
the hopes of conducting a popular and triumphant war. But whatever
were his motives, let it be remembered, to his honour, that
French bribery, so common among the British ministers of the
period, had no influence with Shaftesbury. Whether he found the
war, ill managed by the court, and ill relished by the nation, was
likely to do very little honour to those who had pushed it on; or
whether he was dissatisfied with the share he enjoyed of the king's
favour; or, finally, whether distrusting the easiness and mutability
of the king's temper, is absolutely uncertain; but, moved either
by these, or more patriotic motives, Shaftesbury, in the parliament
of 1672-3, although in office, showed himself prepared to join opposition
on very short notice.</p>

<p>Two circumstances seem chiefly to have influenced Shaftesbury
in his change of politics in 1672. Some vacancies had occurred in
the House of Commons, during a recess of parliament. These his
lordship, as chancellor, had caused to be filled up, by issuing writs
for election, of his own authority, without waiting for the speaker's
warrant; a proceeding, which was deemed by the House an undue
exertion of prerogative, and the elections were declared irregular
and null. This greatly irritated Shaftesbury's haughty temper,
who thought the crown did not support him with sufficient energy,
in a step which he had taken to extend its influence. From this
he judged, that the king had not energy sufficient to venture upon
bold measures; and, consequently, that there was no room for
the game of a minister, who delighted in bold and masterly strokes
of policy. But this was yet more to be inferred from the king's
conduct in the matter of the Indulgence. This was a declaration,
which the king, by advice of Shaftesbury and his other ministers,
had sent forth, on the 25th March, 1672, dispensing with
the penal laws against non-conformists of every description, and
indulging to Protestant dissenters the public, and to Catholics the
private exercise of their religious worship. It is remarkable, that
Shaftesbury, afterwards the champion for the test against popery,
was made chancellor, chiefly for the purpose of affixing
the great seal to this declaration, which the Lord Keeper Bridgeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
refused to do. The House of Commons remonstrated against
this exercise of prerogative. After an inefficient struggle, Charles
recalled the declaration, and broke the seals with his own hand.
From that moment Shaftesbury declared, that the king had forsaken
himself, and deserved to be forsaken. Suspicious that a monarch,
who preferred so evidently his peace and pleasures to his prerogative,
would not hesitate to make the lesser sacrifice of an obnoxious
minister; anxious also, on account of the preponderance of the
Duke of York, who hated him, and whom he hated, the Chancellor
probably foresaw, that, in making an apparent sacrifice of court favour,
he would not only save himself, but become the leader, instead
of being the victim, of the popular faction. Accordingly, he
promoted the test act in the House of Commons, and stood forth
in the House of Lords as the leader of the Protestant party, whom
the declaration had grievously alarmed. From so unexpected a
change, at this eventful period, his removal from office was a matter
of course. But in the mode of accomplishing it, circumstances
occurred, which strongly mark the character of Shaftesbury, who
delighted in an opportunity of teasing and alarming his enemies,
even in the very act of retreating before them. When he waited
upon the king, to surrender the seals, he observed a circle of his
enemies in the anti-chamber, anticipating, with triumph, his returning
without these badges of his office. Upon obtaining his
audience, the falling minister begged the king, that his dismissal
might be so arranged, as not to appear as it he was thrown off with
contempt. "Godsfish," replied the good-natured monarch, "I
will not do it with any circumstance that looks like an affront."
The earl then begged permission to carry the seals before the
king to chapel, and return them afterwards from his house. His
boon being granted, he carried on the conversation with much
humour, upon such gay subjects as usually entertained the king,
while his adversaries, upon the tenterhooks of anxiety, awaited the
issue of so long an audience. But when they saw the king and
the chancellor come out together smiling, and go in company to
the chapel, the party concluded Shaftesbury's peace was made,
and his expected successor was inconsolable. After enjoying this
little triumph, Shaftesbury sent the seals to the king, and placed
himself at the head of the country party, who, from the general
and well-founded opinion of his talents, did not hesitate to adopt
as their leader, one who had just deserted the banners of the
enemy.</p>

<p>From this time, Shaftesbury must always be considered as in
opposition to the court. For, although a number of the country
party were admitted into the council of state, formed by the advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
of Temple, and Shaftesbury himself was president, he was,
in fact, no more united to the king's party, than a detachment of
besiegers become a part of the garrison of a besieged town, because
a bastion or redoubt has been surrendered to them by capitulation.</p>

<p>This was the argument concerning the credibility of the plot-witnesses,
which was so triumphantly urged by the Tories, who
asked, "Are not these men good witnesses, upon whose testimony
Stafford, and so many Catholics, have been executed, and whom
you yourselves have so long celebrated as men of credit and veracity?
You have admitted them into your bosom; they are best
acquainted with your treasons. They are determined in another
shape to serve their king and country; and you cannot complain,
that the same measure which you meted to others, should now, by
a righteous doom of vengeance, be measured out to you."<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> To this
there was but one answer: "We have been duped by our own prejudices,
and the perjury of these men; but you, by employing
against us witnesses whom you know to be forsworn villains, and
whom their versatility has sufficiently proved to be such, are doing
with your eyes open what we did in the blindness of prejudice,
and are worse than us, as guilt is worse than folly." But this,
though the Whigs' true defence, required a candid disavowal of the
Popish plot, and reprobation of the witnesses; and that no true
Protestant would submit to.</p>

<p>As matters carried more and more the appearance of actual insurrection
and civil war, the more wealthy of the citizens of London,
to whom nothing could be more ruinous than such an event,
began to draw to the royal party. They were grieved also, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
the ancient course of feasting and hospitality, observed by former
sheriffs, had given way for furious cabals in coffee-houses; and,
by degrees, a large body of citizens, who had, according to North,
good hearts, and good spirits, were formed for the purpose of restoring
the ancient order and course of living in the city. By
means of this party, Sir John Moor was elected Lord Mayor; for
whose character and conduct, and that of Shute and Pilkington,
the Whig sheriffs, whom Dryden here terms his "two gouty
hands," see the two last notes on the Second Part of "Absalom
and Achitophel," pp. 401, 403. It was a great advantage to the
court, that the military chiefs of the city, <i>i. e.</i> the officers of the
trained bands, &amp;c. were attached to the royal cause; and it was
very much by their emphatic interference, that the election of
sheriffs for 1683 was carried against the Whig party.</p>

<p>Until 1663, milled money was not struck in England; and the
hammered coin, which continued to be in circulation long after that
period, was liable to be clipped, which occasioned great frauds on
the public, and loss to individuals. It is remarkable, that the
verses which follow, describing the cypher-like state of royalty, to
which the country party wished to reduce the king, agree accurately
with what North believed to be Shaftesbury's real designs
upon the authority and person of Charles. "If he was really a
friend to any human kind, besides himself, I believe it was to King
Charles the second; whose gaiety, breeding, wit, good-humour,
familiarity, and disposition to enjoy the pleasures of society and
greatness, engaged him very much, that had a great share of wit,
agreeableness, and gallantry himself. But this same superiority
spoiled all; his majesty would not always be influenced by him,
but would take short turns on his toe, and so frustrate his projects;
and finding by that he could not work under him, he
strove, if possible, to reduce his authority, and get above him. It
seems, by what was given out, that he would not have hurt the
king personally, but kept him tame in a cage, with his ordinary
pleasures about him. And if he was privy to the cruel stroke intended
at the Rye, or any way concurring, it was the necessity of
affairs, such as are laws to a politician, and superior to all human
engagements, that obliged him. And of that sort, the chief was
self-preservation; for, though he had found the king very easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
reconciled, as not being in his nature vindicative, it was possible
that humour, as age advanced, might spend; and he had launched
so deep in treason, as it seemed necessary that either the king
or he should fall." <i>Examen.</i> p. 119.</p>

of the famous Edmund Hickeringill, who had been originally
one of Cromwell's fighting saints, was at this time rector

fanatical pamphlets, songs, and sermons.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> This reverend

this book in a day&mdash;it may be so.</p>

<p>"But it is a truth, as certain and stable as the sun in the firmament,
and which, if need be, the bookseller, printer, and other
worthy citizens that are privy to it, can avouch for an infallible
truth&mdash;<i>deo soli gloria</i>&mdash;when a divine hand assists, one of despicable,
dull, and inconsiderate parts, may do wonders, which God
usually performs by most weak and unlikely instruments."</p>

<p>A single extract more may be added, to shew the high popularity
of "Absalom and Achitophel" among the country gentlemen
of England. "What sport it is to see an old country justice,
with his eager chaplain at his elbow, putting his barnacles on his
nose; bless us, how he gapes and admires Nat. Thomson, the addresses
in the Gazette, Abhorrences, Heraclitus, or the Observator!
But shew him but&mdash;"Absalom and Achitophel"&mdash;oh&mdash;then
the man's horn mad, there's no holding him; then he hunts up,
and though in his dining-room, how he spends, with double mouth,
and whoops and hallows, just as he hunts his dogs when at full cry.
"That&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;Rattle&mdash;Towzer&mdash;Bulldog&mdash;Thunder&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;"
while the little trencher-chaplain echoes to him,
and cries, "<i>Amen</i>."</p>

<p>Shaftesbury was at this period little above sixty years old.
But he was in a state of premature decrepitude; partly owing to
natural feebleness of body, and partly to an injury which he received
by an overturn in a Dutch carriage when he was in Holland,
in 1660, as one of the parliamentary committee. He received
on this occasion a wound, or bruise in his side, which came to an
internal exulceration; so that in the year 1672 he was opened by
Mr Knolls the surgeon, under the direction of Dr Willis, and an
issue inserted for the regular discharge of the humour. This one
of his biographers has called the "greatest cure that ever was
done on the body of man."<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The royalists forgot the honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
cause in which this injury was received, nothing less than a
journey undertaken to invite the king to repossession of his throne,
when they made its consequences the subject of scurrilous jests.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
Dryden had already called Shaftesbury "the formidable cripple;"
and in the Essay of Satire, he sarcastically describes the contrast
between the activity of his spirit, and the decrepitude of his
person.</p>

fortune, no eminent qualities of body, which have sometimes, or of mind,
which have often, raised men to the highest dignities, should have the courage
to attempt, and the happiness to succeed in, so improbable a design, as
the destruction of one of the most ancient, and most solid founded monarchies
upon the earth? That he should have the power, or boldness, to put his
prince and master to an open and infamous death? To banish that numerous
and strongly allied family? To do all this under the name and wages of a
parliament? To trample upon them, too, as he pleased, and spurn them out
of doors when he grew weary of them? To raise up a new and unheard-of
monster out of their ashes? To stifle that in the very infancy, and set up himself
above all things that ever were called sovereign in England? To oppress
all his enemies by arms, and all his friends afterwards by artifice? To serve
all parties patiently for a while, and to command them victoriously at last?
To over-run each corner of the three nations, and overcome with equal facility
both the riches of the south and the poverty of the north? To be feared
and courted by all foreign princes, and adopted a brother to the gods of the
earth? To call together parliaments with a word of his pen, and scatter them
again with the breath of his mouth? To be humbly and daily petitioned,
that he would please to be hired, at the rate of two millions a year, to be the
master of those who had hired him before to be their servant? To have the
estates and lives of three kingdoms as much at his disposal, as was the little
inheritance of his father, and to be as noble and liberal in the spending of
them? And, lastly, (for there is no end of all the particulars of his glory,)
to bequeath all this with one word to his posterity? To die with peace at
home, and triumph abroad? To be buried among kings, and with more than
regal solemnity? And to leave a name behind him, not to be extinguished
but with the whole world, which as it is now too little for his praises, so
might have been too for his conquests if the short line of his human life could
have been stretched out to the extent of his immortal designs?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cowley's</span>

<p>Perhaps the facetious Tom Brown has hit upon the true reason of Dryden's
choice of a subject, when he makes him say, "that he had no particular kindness
for the person of Oliver; but that it was much the same with the poets
as with the Jews&mdash;a hero cannot start up in any quarter of the world, be his
quarrel right or wrong, but both are apt to think him the Messias, and presently
pitch upon him as the fittest person to deliver the twelve tribes and
the nine muses out of captivity."&mdash;<cite>Reasons of Mr Bayes' changing his religion.</cite></p></div>

their own allies and kinsmen. A judge, who lived within the eighteenth century,
justified this partiality for "kith, kin, and ally," by saying, "that, upon
his conscience, he could never see any of his friends were in the <i>wrong</i>;"
and the upright conduct of Cromwell's English judges being objected to him,
he answered, "it was not wonderful, since they were a set of <i>kinless louns</i>
who had no family connections to bias them."</p></div>

by clergymen, and scholars, and persons of honour. Among them, the verses
by Waller are most celebrated; though inferior to those which he composed
on the Protector's death. When Charles made this remark, the bard, with
great felicity, reminded his Majesty, that poets always excel in fiction.
Among other topics, he enlarges on the "tried virtue, and the sacred word,"
of the witty monarch. It is singular, that, of the three distinguished poets,
who solemnized by elegy the death of the Protector, Dryden and Waller
should have hailed the restoration of the Stuart line, and Sprat have favoured
their most arbitrary aggressions upon liberty.</p></div>

the following account of his examination before Parliament:</p>

<p>"Yesterday Harman was brought to the house, to give an account of slackening
sail in the first victory. He had a very good reputation at his coming
in; but when he said, that Mr Bronkard only used arguments, and justified
the thing himself, saying, 'That he had been a madman had he not done it;'
and other witnesses clearly contradicting this, and proving, that Bronkard
brought him orders in the Duke's name, he lost all credit with us; and yet
more, when, upon recollection, he confessed that Mr Bronkard did bring
orders as from the Duke: so he is committed to the sergeant, and will doubtless
be impeached. Both he and Mr Bronkard, who was also heard, will probably,
on Tuesday next, taste the utmost severity of the house." <span class="smcap">Andrew

himself to have been eye-witness to so marvellous a chase. The "so have

Holy Scriptures, in Heroic Verse, printed for C. R. 1679."</p>

<p>"Since holy scripture itself is not exempt from being tortured and abused
by the strainings and perversions of evil men, no great wonder were it if this
small poem, which is but an illustration of a single, yet remarkable, passage
thereof, be also subject to the like distortions and misapplications of the over-prying
and underwitted of one side, and of the malicious on the other: But
all ingenious and ingenuous men (to whose divertisement only this poem offers
itself) will be guarantees for the author, that neither any honourable and
just judge can be thought concerned in the character of Arod, nor any honest
and veracious witness in that of Malchus: And as, by the singular care and
royal goodness of his Majesty, whom God long preserve, our benches in this
nation are furnished with persons of such eminent integrity and ability, that
no character of a corrupt judge can, with the least shadow of resemblance,
belong to them; so it is to be wished, that also, in all our courts of judicature,
a proportionable honesty and veracity were to be found in all witnesses,
that so justice and peace might close in a happy kiss."</p>

is said to have been a governor. But, from the records of the foundation,
it appears that Erasmus Henry Dryden, the third son of the poet, to
whom, if to any, the story must apply, was not admitted a scholar till more
than a year after the publication of the second edition of the poem, containing
the additional lines above quoted, to which the said admission is stated
to have given occasion. There are, besides, two admirable reasons for believing
that Shaftesbury had no hand in this matter, since, first, young
Dryden was admitted on the recommendation of the king himself; secondly,
Shaftesbury happened to be dead at the time. See <cite>Malone's Dryden</cite>,
Vol. I. p. 148. The following is the note of admissions referred to by Mr.
Malone:</p>

<p>"October 6th, 1681, [six weeks before the publication of 'Absalom and
Achitophel'] Samuel Weaver, admitted for the Lord Shaftesbury.</p>

<p>"Feb. 5th, 1682-3, Erasmus-Henry Dryden, admitted <i>for his majesty</i> (in
the room of Orlando Bagnall); aged 14 years, 2d of May next.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_217_217" id="Footnote_217_217"></a><a href="#FNanchor_217_217"><span class="label">[217]</span></a> These famous expressions of party distinction were just coming
into fashion. Whig, a contraction of Whigamore, is a word
used by the peasantry in the west of Scotland in driving their
horses, and gave a name to those fanatics who were the supporters
of the Covenant in that part of Scotland. It was first used to designate
an insurrection of these people in 1648, called the Whigamore's
road. It has been less accurately derived from the sour-milk
used by these people, called whig. But the former use of
the word was much more likely to afford a party appellation.&mdash;The
Tories owe their distinctive epithet to the Irish banditti, who
used the word Toree, or "give me," in robbing passengers. Hence,
in the old translation of Buchanan's History, the followers of
Buccleuch are called the Tories of Teviotdale. As, from religion
and other motives, the Irish were almost all attached to the Duke
of York, the word Tory was generally applied to his party by
the opposite faction, who, on the other hand, were called Whigs,
as having embraced the fanatical and rebellious principles of the
Scottish covenanters. The Duke of York's followers are supposed
to be thus described by his Grace himself, in a lampoon called
"Popish Politics unmasked:"</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I have my teagues and <em>tories</em> at my beck,</div>
  <div class="i0">Will wring their heads off like a chicken's neck.</div>
  <div class="i1">&mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Others wo'nt serve you but on constant pay,</div>
  <div class="i0">My hounds will hunt and live upon their prey;</div>
  <div class="i0">A virgin's haunch, or well-baked ladies breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">To them is better than a ven'son feast;</div>
  <div class="i0">Babes pettitoes cut large, with arms and legs,</div>
  <div class="i0">They far prefer to pettitoes of pigs.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the first applications of the word Tory to a party purpose,
occurs in "a True Relation of a late Barbarous Assault
committed on Robert Pye, Esq." in which one John Bodnam,
of Brunguin, in the county of Hereford, "an obstinate and
violent papist," is said by the author to have defended himself
against the constable and his assistants "so well, or rather so
ill," that they were forced to retire and leave him "than which a
<em>Toree</em> or an Outlaw could have done no more." Finally, the justice
having appeared in person, Mr Bodnam, "in good earnest let
fly at his head with a hedge-bill," which, the author says, is "no bad
argument for the truth of the black bills prepared for the papists in
Ireland." This paper is dated 1681.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_218_218" id="Footnote_218_218"></a><a href="#FNanchor_218_218"><span class="label">[218]</span></a> Birmingham was already noted for base and counterfeit coinage.
In a Panegyrick on their Royal Highnesses congratulating
their return from Scotland, 1682, mention is thus made of Shaftesbury's
medal:
</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The wretch that stamped it got immortal fame;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas coined by stealth, like groats at Birmingham.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tom Brown also alluded to the same practice; "I coined heroes
as fast as Brumingham groats."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The affected zeal of the country
party for the Protestant religion, led them to be called Birmingham
Protestants, while the pretensions of Monmouth to legitimacy
led his adversaries to compare him to a spurious impression
of the king's coin; and thus <em>Birmingham</em> became a term of reproach
for him, his assumed title, and his faction in general. There
are numerous allusions to this in the libels of the age. Thus, in
"Old Jemmy, an excellent new Ballad,"</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Old Jemmy is the top,</div>
  <div class="i1">And cheef among the princes;</div>
  <div class="i0">No mobile gay fop</div>
  <div class="i1">With Bromingham pretences.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another ballad bearing the same title, the same phrase occurs:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Let Whig and Bremingham repine,</div>
  <div class="i1">They shew their teeth in vain;</div>
  <div class="i0">The glory of the British line,</div>
  <div class="i1">Old Jemmy's come again.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are in Mr Luttrell's collection; where there is another
Tory song, entitled, "A proper new Birmingham ballad, to the
tune of Hey Boys Up Go We."</p>

<p>In another Grubstreet performance, entitled, "a Medley on the
plot, by Mathew Taubman:"</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Confound the hypocrites, Birminghams royal,</div>
  <div class="i1">Who thinks allegeance a transgression;</div>
  <div class="i0">Since to oppose the king is counted loyal,</div>
  <div class="i1">And to rail high at the succession.</div>
  <div class="i2">&mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let them boast of loyal Birminghams, and true,</div>
  <div class="i1">And with these make up their kirk of separation;</div>
  <div class="i0">We have honest Tory Tom, Dick, and Hugh,</div>
  <div class="i1">Will drink on, and do more service for the nation.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>North, however, gives rather a different derivation. He says,
that the loyalists, becoming anxious to retort some nickname in
return for that of tories with which they had been branded, first
called their "adversaries <i>true blues</i>; because such were not satisfied
to be Protestants as the churchmen were, but must be true
Protestants, implying the others to be false ones, just not Papists.
Then they went on, and stiled the adversary <i>Birmingham</i> Protestants,
alluding to the false groats struck at that place. This
held a considerable time; but the word was not fluent enough for
hasty repartee, and after divers changes, the lot fell on the word
whig, which was very significative, as well as ready, being vernacular
in Scotland, whence it was borrowed, for sour and corrupted
whey. Immediately the train took, and, upon the first touch of
the experiment, it ran like wild fire, and became general." <cite>Examen.
p. 321.</cite></p>

<p>By the phrase of Anti-Brominghams, used in the text, Dryden
therefore means those who opposed the duke of Monmouth's pretensions,
and were execrated for doing so by his fanatical followers.</p></div>

The Editor has often heard it mentioned by his father, who was curious in
historical antiquities, and who gave it on the report of his grandfather, to
whom Captain Scott had told the story. According to this last authority, which
the relationship between the parties renders probable, the intercepted letter
contained some details concerning the Prince of Orange's intrigues with Monmouth,
and the duplicity of Sunderland. It is more than probable, if that
wise prince encouraged Monmouth in his enterprise, it could only be with
the purpose of hastening his destruction.</p></div>

popular clamour, was in the "Observator," and other periodical or occasional
publications of L'Estrange, which had a great effect on the public mind.
But during the first clamorous outcry after the Popish plot was started, nothing
of this kind was, or probably could be, attempted; while, on the other
hand, the press teemed with all manner of narratives of the plot, every one
stuffed with more horrid circumstances than those which preceded it; and the
sale of which was no inconsiderable part of the recompence of the various
witnesses by whom they were composed, sworn to, and published.</p></div>

for aiding Braddon in his enquiry into the death of the Earl of
Essex. The other was executed for joining in Monmouth's invasion. Jefferies
exclaimed on his trial, that his family owed justice a life, and that he
should die for the sake of his name.</p></div>

themselves as brave officers; and it is remarkable that neither seemed to
have a feeling of the base and dishonourable nature of their undertaking.
The third, Borosky, was a poor Pole, who thought himself justified by his
master's orders. There is an interesting account of their behaviour in prison,
and at execution, in the Harleian Miscellany.</p></div>

proverbial; yet there is at least little pretension in that despised version, and
it gives us, in a homely old-fashioned metre and diction, the sense of the
Hebrew authors. But, in Tate and Brady, there is a vain attempt to grace
the inspired songs with the incongruous ornaments of modern taste. On the
whole, it is perhaps impossible to transfuse the beauties of oriental poetry into
a metrical translation. It is remarkable, that, in this very poem, Dryden
uses these translations to express nearly the lowest of all poetry. He calls
the Whig poets,</p>

to themselves the following objects, which are sure to come to pass whenever
popery prevails, <i>i. e.</i> when the Duke of York succeeds to the throne.</p>

<p>"First, imagine you see the whole town in a flame, occasioned this second
time by the same popish malice that set it on fire before. At the same time
fancy, that, among the distracted crowd, you behold troops of Papists ravishing
your wives and daughters, dashing your little childrens' brains out against the
wall, plundering your houses, and cutting your own throats, by the name of heretic
dogs. Then represent to yourselves the Tower playing off its cannon, and
battering down your houses about your ears. Also, casting your eye towards
Smithfield, imagine you see your father, or your mother, or some of your nearest
and dearest relations, tied to a stake, in the midst of flames, when, with
hands and eyes lifted up to heaven, they scream and cry out to that God, for
whose cause they die, which was a frequent spectacle the last time Popery
reigned amongst us. Fancy you behold those beautiful churches, erected
for the true worship of God, abused and turned into idolatrous temples, to
the dishonour of Christ, and scandal of religion; the ministers of God's
word torn to pieces before their eyes, and their very best friends not daring
even to speak in their behalf. Your trading's bad, and in a manner lost already,
but then the only commodity will be fire and sword; the only object,
women running with their hair about their ears, men covered with blood,
children sprawling under horses feet, and only the walls of houses left standing;
when those that survive this fatal day may sigh and cry, Here once
stood my house, there my friend's, and there my kinsman's; but, alas! that
time is past. The only noise will then be, O my wife, O my husband, O my
dearest children! In fine, what the devil himself would do, were he upon
earth, will, in his absence, infallibly be acted by his agents the Papists." See
<cite>State Tracts</cite>, p. 102. Burnet mentions Ferguson being the author, in his "Letter
occasioned by a Second Letter to Dr Burnet."</p></div>

observe, that, as there might have been an hundred, so there actually were at
least two Zimris in scripture story; the second of whom rebelled against his
master, Elah, king of Israel, and usurped the kingdom. If Dryden meant to
apply either of these characters distinctly to the factious Duke of Buckingham,
it was probably the last, whose treason had become proverbial: "Had
Zimri peace, who slew his master?"</p></div>

representations. From a letter of the facetious Tom Brown, we learn, that a
variety of performers appeared upon temporary stages during these festive
assemblies. To write drolls for them, and for the puppet-shows, though the
last state of literary degradation, may have been attended with some scantling
of profit. Dryden calls Settle "a Bartholomew-fair writer," in the

city, who made lately the humble address to his majesty, dined at Sadler's
Hall. The king had been pleased to give them a brace of bucks, and many
of the principal nobility, and other persons of quality, did them the honour
to dine with them; there was a very handsome entertainment, managed with
great order; and they intending to keep an annual feast, desired his grace the
Duke of Grafton, and some others of the nobility, to be stewards for the next
year." <i>Gazette</i>, No. 1640. Accordingly, the next year, the Duke of Grafton
presided on the 9th August, 1682. This was one of the devices by
which the court endeavoured to strengthen their ground in the city against
Shaftesbury and Monmouth, and was much canvassed in the pamphlets, &amp;c.
of the time. In Luttrell's Collection, are the following poems on the 'Prentices

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">

  <div class="i0">If Whigs be silent, then the Tory says,</div>

  <div class="i0">Nay, he's so charitable, we so poor,</div>
  <div class="i0">He bids us take, and welcome, of his store;</div>
  <div class="i0">And lest our verses happen to want feet,</div>
  <div class="i0">He frankly proffers his; and 'tis most meet</div>
  <div class="i0">We should, in charity, accept his proffer now,</div>
  <div class="i0">For his, like that, has more than should by two.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same circumstance is noticed by Tom Brown, who says, it is the longest
line in Christendom, except one, which went round some old hangings, representing
the history of Pharoah and Moses, and measured forty-six good
feet of metre, running thus:</p>

<div class="container">

Bridge, Temple-Bar, &amp;c. Roger North mentions it as a very unpleasant
part of his brother Dudley's office of sheriff, that the executioner
came to him for orders, touching the disposal of the limbs of
those who had suffered. "Once, while he was abroad, a cart, with
some of them, came into the court-yard of his house, and frighted

concerning the draught of the Association, found in Shaftesbury's
study; for, while they endeavoured to defend the purpose and
principles for which it was proposed, they insinuated, that it might
possibly have been shuffled in amongst Lord Shaftesbury's papers,
by the messenger who seized them. It was said, to strengthen this
suspicion, that Wilson, the earl's secretary, was employed by him
to indorse all the papers which the messengers seized and carried
off, and that this scroll bore no such indorsement: it was even
added, that Wilson himself was imprisoned, to deprive Shaftesbury
of the benefit of his evidence to this point. There is, however,
no reason to think the paper was not actually found in the earl's
repositories.</p></div>

subjects of Queen Elizabeth, for the defence of her person, supposed
to be endangered by the plots of the Catholics and
malcontents. Many of its most striking expressions are copied
into the draught found in Shaftesbury's house. It was confirmed
by act 27th of Queen Elizabeth, and cannot but be supposed as
acceptable to the crown, as that of Shaftesbury would have been
obnoxious.</p></div>

given, appears from the "Loyal Medal Vindicated," published
in 1681, and addressed,</p>

<p class="center">"To the Disloyal Tories.</p>

<p>"To all, I mean, except the author of the Medal; for he being
a Tory of two editions, it seems impossible to appropriate his genius
more to King Charles than Oliver Cromwell. And if Noll
was so kind, though a saucy tenant, to leave him as a heriot of
the muses, unto whomsoever should possess Whitehall, let none admire
that he, that could so deify an usurper, does afterwards endeavour
to expiate that crime by <em>Torifying</em> the government of a legal
monarch, &amp;c. I have no more to say to him, and his Tory friends,
by way of argument, but rather greet him, in conclusion, as poetically
as he can pretend to deserve." The following introduction
may suffice to shew how far the poetry was commensurate to the
deserts of Dryden:</p>

plead it for the apology of having degraded himself by a controversy
with Dryden. "I have more honourable employ, than,
like a schoolboy, to cap verses, or to blemish my larger name
with that of Bayes or Laureat. Only, it moved my indignation,
as well as scorn, when I read his challenge to the Whigs, p. 6. of
his Epistle, and the bravado extorted from me this nimble check,
but just rebuke, for such arrogance, opiniatry, and petulancy, to
abate, if possible, his pride, and the contempt he seems to have
of the Whigs, whom the hackney laureat does so magisterially
despise at such a rate, that the Tory courtiers (poor hearts, they
know no better) hug and admire the imbost rhodomontade."&mdash;<i>Mushroom</i>,
p. 18. How far the author's talents were equal to
the purpose of chastizing Dryden, and raising the renown of Whig
poetry, may be seen by some curious specimens in Note XII. on
the following poem.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_481_481" id="Footnote_481_481"></a><a href="#FNanchor_481_481"><span class="label">[481]</span></a> As I have not as yet been able to meet with the "Whip and
Key," I subjoin the account which Mr Malone has given of it:
"A Whip for the Fool's Back, who styles honourable marriage a
cursed confinement, in his profane poem of Absalom and Achitophel;"
and this was followed, on the 18th of January, by "A
Key (with the Whip) to open the mystery and iniquity of the poem
called Absalom and Achitophel, shewing its scurrilous reflections
on both king and kingdom." In the latter piece, which was written
by the same hand as the former, the author's principal object
is to show, that Dryden's Jewish names were not well chosen. As
probably very few of my readers have ever seen this poem, I will
add a short extract:</p>

<p>It must also be noticed, that the author of the "Whip and
Key" opens his poem with the ten first lines of "Absalom and
Achitophel."</p></div>

by favouring us with an account of Shaftesbury's brother, George
Cooper, Esq. This is a remarkable instance of a knavish speech
sleeping in a foolish ear. For the benefit of any person of equally
obtuse intellects, it may be necessary to say, the non-conformist
parson is the party meant, whom Dryden styles "brother to Achitophel,"
if Achitophel, according to his own derivation, be brother
to a fool; and truly the commentator seems to have been of the
kindred.</p></div>

a Papist, or a woman; Nell at length looked out, and convinced
them of their mistake, by assuring them "she was the <cite>Protestant

Whigs, concerning the author of "The Medal." Settle, himself, did not
recognize the hand of Dryden; for he thus expresses himself:&mdash;"I am
not of opinion, that the author of "The Medal," and that of "Absalom
and Achitophel," is one person, since the style and painting is far different,
and their satires are of a different hue, the one being a much more
slovenly beast than the other; yet, since they desire to be thought so, let
the one bear the reproaches of the other."&mdash;<i>Preface to Medal Reversed.</i></p></div>

come in, had hanged him at Tyburn, and afterwards stole the crown, though
he was not so happy as to carry it off,) no player at small games; he, even
he, the virtuous colonel, was to have been destroyed by the Papists. It seems
these Papists would let no eminent Protestant be safe. But some amends
were made; the colonel, by the sale of the narrative, licensed Thomas Blood.
It had been strange if so much mischief had been stirring, and he not come
in for a snack."&mdash;<i>Examen</i>, p. 311. The narrative is now before me, in which
I observe Colonel Blood very feelingly complains, "that those who are to
deal with Jesuits and their disciples, had need to have as well the prudence
of serpents, as the innocence of doves."</p></div>
